#### Short list of changes compared to the previous version 'geklojban-1.2.6 April 2020'

* "The cmavo tu'a is used in forming abstractions, and is explained more fully in Section 11.11." but it isn't mentioned at all in that section. Changed the reference to Section 11.10. The bug is noticed by [Robert Baruch](https://github.com/RobertBaruch).
* all the references to selma'o are moved from lojban words index to general index in the appendix.
* Section 10.18. The phrase "Unlike -nai contradictory negation, scalar negation of tenses is not limited to PU and FAhA:" contradicted the following text of the section. Replaced with "An example of scalar negation of FAhA:"
