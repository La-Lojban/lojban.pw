Lojban does not require any punctuation, separate words are used instead. Punctuation marks like _! ? “ ”_ can be used for stylistic purposes or to make the text look smarter. They don't add or change the meaning. Note that the symbol **.** (dot) can be used as we use dot in English (i.e. as a punctuation mark) but its main purpose in Lojban is that it is a proper letter that denotes a pause.

**Lojban made easy**

The guide to a speakable logical language

Published 2019

This simplified course covers the most important aspects of Lojban, a logical language.

# Introduction

## Why was this book born?

I first learned of Lojban while browsing Wikipedia. First I didn't pay much attention to it. But as I read more of its description I became more and more fascinated.

A language allegedly based on formal logic, precisely described like some programming language and still speakable. A language where verbs and nouns don't differ and probably don't exist. And then those pronounceable smileys... but wait! It is a logical language. Where do emotions come from in the world of logic?

I looked into it deeper and deeper. Looking back I can see these reasons why I got interested in Lojban:

- I wanted to try new ways of thinking.
- I wanted a beautiful language.
- I wanted a powerful language being able to combine art and logic.

I heard others saying that Lojban is extremely hard to learn but what I discovered in it later was power.

Go on reading and you'll get evidence for that.

I also learnt that Lojban allows saying things shorter without unnecessary distracting details. For example, one doesn't have to always think of what tense (past, present or future) to use in a verb when it's already clear from context: when you need details you add them. But unlike other languages Lojban doesn't force you to do so.

But why did I decide to write my own course?

When I first opened textbooks on Lojban ... darn, they were written not for humans for sure. An awkward and boring style making it impossible to learn the language fast. A lot of distracting not necessary details, no solutions for real situations and bulky, bulky, bulky.

And I this is where this course has its roots. I said "Enough! If you can't explain it yourself then I'll do that, in simpler words, with better examples and as concise as possible."

## Learning curve

Lojban is likely to be very different to the kinds of languages you are familiar with — which certainly include English. Learning it is much more than just learning its words and grammar: it is more about understanding it. It will make you think about the ways you express ideas in words. Something that you learned and used every day but never tried to understand how it works.

Learning may be easy or hard, depending on how well you understand the ideas behind it. There are not many words and rules that you need to learn to get into a basic level. You will get there rather quickly if you put a systemic effort. On the other hand, if you fail to understand some basic point, memorizing things will not help you much. In such cases don't hesitate to move on, and come back to it later. Likewise, some of the exercises are trickier than others (particularly the translation exercises at the end of sections). If you can't work out the answer to a particular question, feel free to skip it — but do look at the answer to the question.
