      Lojban (pronounced
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">LOZH-bahn</span>”</span>) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Loglan</span>”</span>
      by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article
      “<span class="citetitle">Loglan</span>”
      , published in
      <em class="citetitle">Scientific American</em>
      , June, 1960. Made well-known by that article and by occasional references in science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel
      <em class="citetitle">The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</em>) and computer publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group (who are the publishers of this book).

      There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of Lojban:
