------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a id="id-1.8.17.2.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.17.2.2" class="indexterm"></a>There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See [Section 7.16](../section-koha-summary) for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.

<a id="id-1.8.17.3.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.17.3.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.17.3.3" class="indexterm"></a>Thus _<a id="id-1.8.17.3.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_donta'a_](../go01#valsi-dontaha)_, meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _<a id="id-1.8.17.3.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>tavla be do_, and would have the place structure

<div class="interlinear-gloss-example example">
<a id="example-random-id-unmV"></a>

**Example 7.76. <a id="c7e15d1"></a>** 

> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4

</div>  

since t2 (the addressee) is already known to be _<a id="id-1.8.17.5.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_do_](../go01#valsi-do)_.

<a id="id-1.8.17.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>On the other hand, the lujvo _<a id="id-1.8.17.6.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_donma'o_](../go01#valsi-donmaho)_, literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _<a id="id-1.8.17.6.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>cmavo be zo do_, and have the place structure:

<div class="interlinear-gloss-example example">
<a id="example-random-id-H5NB"></a>

**Example 7.77. <a id="c7e15d2"></a>** 

> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4

</div>  

since both the c2 place (the grammatical class) and the c3 place (the meaning) are obvious from the context _<a id="id-1.8.17.8.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_do_](../go01#valsi-do)_.

<a id="id-1.8.17.9.1" class="indexterm"></a>An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the _<a id="id-1.8.17.9.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_fo'a_](../go01#valsi-foha)_ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmevla, and so forth). An example would be:

<div class="interlinear-gloss-example example">
<a id="example-random-id-tH6w"></a>

**Example 7.78. <a id="c7e15d3"></a>** 

<table class="interlinear-gloss"><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr class="jbo"><td>fo'a</td><td>goi</td><td>le</td><td>kulnrsu,omi</td><td>.i</td><td>lo</td><td>fo'arselsanga</td></tr><tr class="gloss"><td>x<sub>6</sub></td><td>stands-for</td><td>the</td><td>Finnish-culture</td><td>.</td><td>An</td><td>x<sub>6</sub>-song.</td></tr></tbody></table>

</div>  

<a id="id-1.8.17.11.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.17.11.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.17.11.3" class="indexterm"></a>Finally, lujvo involving _<a id="id-1.8.17.11.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_zi'o_](../go01#valsi-ziho)_ are also possible. The convention is to use the rafsi for _<a id="id-1.8.17.11.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_zi'o_](../go01#valsi-ziho)_ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _<a id="id-1.8.17.11.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>se pinxe be zi'o_, the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _<a id="id-1.8.17.11.8.1" class="indexterm"></a>se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_, and _<a id="id-1.8.17.11.12.1" class="indexterm"></a>lo zilpavypinxe_, like _<a id="id-1.8.17.11.13.1" class="indexterm"></a>lo zilrelselpinxe_, refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.

<a id="id-1.8.17.12.1" class="indexterm"></a>The pro-bridi _<a id="id-1.8.17.12.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_co'e_](../go01#valsi-cohe)_, _<a id="id-1.8.17.12.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_du_](../go01#valsi-du)_, and _<a id="id-1.8.17.12.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu'a_](../go01#valsi-buha)_ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _<a id="id-1.8.17.12.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.
