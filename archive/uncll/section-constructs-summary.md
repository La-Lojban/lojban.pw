-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a id="id-1.15.22.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>The following table specifies, for each kind of construct that can be logically or non-logically connected in Lojban, what kind of connective is required for both afterthought and (when possible) forethought modes. An asterisk (\*) indicates that tensed connection is permitted.

A dash indicates that connection of the specified type is not possible.
