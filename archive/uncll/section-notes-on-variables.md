-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a id="id-1.17.16.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>A variable may have a quantifier placed in front of it even though it has already been quantified explicitly or implicitly by a previous appearance, as in:

<div class="interlinear-gloss-example example">
<a id="example-random-id-x0FP"></a>

**Example 16.108. <a id="c16e14d1"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.3.1.2" class="indexterm"></a>** 

<table class="interlinear-gloss"><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr class="jbo"><td>ci</td><td>da</td><td>poi</td><td>mlatu</td><td>cu</td><td>blabi</td><td>.ije</td><td>re</td><td>da</td><td>cu</td><td>barda</td></tr><tr class="gloss"><td>Three</td><td>Xs</td><td>which-are</td><td>cats</td><td></td><td>are-white,</td><td>and</td><td>two</td><td>Xs</td><td></td><td>are-big.</td></tr></tbody></table>

</div>  

What does [Example 16.108](../section-notes-on-variables#example-random-id-x0FP) mean? The appearance of _<a id="id-1.17.16.4.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>ci da_ quantifies _<a id="id-1.17.16.4.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da_](../go01#valsi-da)_ as referring to three things, which are restricted by the relative clause to be cats. When _<a id="id-1.17.16.4.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>re da_ appears later, it refers to two of those three things – there is no saying which ones. Further uses of _<a id="id-1.17.16.4.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da_](../go01#valsi-da)_ alone, if there were any, would refer once more to the three cats, so the requantification of _<a id="id-1.17.16.4.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da_](../go01#valsi-da)_ is purely local.

<a id="id-1.17.16.5.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.5.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.5.3" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.5.4" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.5.5" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.5.6" class="indexterm"></a>In general, the scope of a prenex that precedes a sentence extends to following sentences that are joined by ijeks (explained in [Section 14.4](../section-bridi-connection)) such as the _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.8.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_.ije_](../go01#valsi-ije)_ in [Example 16.108](../section-notes-on-variables#example-random-id-x0FP). Theoretically, a bare _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.10.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_.i_](../go01#valsi-i)_ terminates the scope of the prenex. Informally, however, variables may persist for a while even after an _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.11.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_.i_](../go01#valsi-i)_ , as if it were an _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.12.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_.ije_](../go01#valsi-ije)_. Prenexes that precede embedded bridi such as relative clauses and abstractions extend only to the end of the clause, as explained in [Section 16.8](../section-any). A prenex preceding _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.14.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_tu'e_](../go01#valsi-tuhe)_ … _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.15.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_tu'u_](../go01#valsi-tuhu)_ long-scope brackets persists until the _<a id="id-1.17.16.5.16.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_tu'u_](../go01#valsi-tuhu)_ , which may be many sentences or even paragraphs later.

<a id="id-1.17.16.6.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.17.16.6.2" class="indexterm"></a>If the variables _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da_](../go01#valsi-da)_ , _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_de_](../go01#valsi-de)_ , and _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_di_](../go01#valsi-di)_ (or the selbri variables _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu'a_](../go01#valsi-buha)_ , _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.7.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu'e_](../go01#valsi-buhe)_ , and _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.8.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu'i_](../go01#valsi-buhi)_) are insufficient in number for handling a particular problem, the Lojban approach is to add a subscript to any of them. Each possible different combination of a subscript and a variable cmavo counts as a distinct variable in Lojban. Subscripts are explained in full in [Section 19.6](../section-subscripts-general) , but in general consist of the cmavo _<a id="id-1.17.16.6.10.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_xi_](../go01#valsi-xi)_ (of selma'o XI) followed by a number, one or more lerfu words forming a single string, or a general mathematical expression enclosed in parentheses.

A quantifier can be prefixed to a variable that has already been bound either in a prenex or earlier in the bridi, thus:

<div class="interlinear-gloss-example example">
<a id="example-random-id-6gyb"></a>

**Example 16.109. <a id="c16e14d2"></a>** 

<table class="interlinear-gloss"><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr class="jbo"><td>ci</td><td>da</td><td>poi</td><td>prenu</td><td>cu</td><td>se&nbsp;ralju</td><td>pa</td><td>da</td></tr><tr class="gloss"><td>Three</td><td>Xs</td><td>which</td><td>are-persons</td><td></td><td>are-led-by</td><td>one-of</td><td>X</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="interlinear-gloss"><tbody><tr class="para"><td colspan="12321"><p class="natlang">Three people are led by one of them.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

</div>  

The _<a id="id-1.17.16.9.1.1" class="indexterm"></a>pa da_ in [Example 16.109](../section-notes-on-variables#example-random-id-6gyb) does not specify the number of things to which _<a id="id-1.17.16.9.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da_](../go01#valsi-da)_ refers, as the preceding _<a id="id-1.17.16.9.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>ci da_ does. Instead, it selects one of them for use in this sumti only. The number of referents of _<a id="id-1.17.16.9.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da_](../go01#valsi-da)_ remains three, but a single one (there is no way of knowing which one) is selected to be the leader.
