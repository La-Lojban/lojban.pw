Bob: Hey there, Alice. Are you feeling alright?

Alice: *coughs* Yeah, I think I caught a cold.

Bob: Oh, that's no good. *burps* Excuse me.

Alice: *sneezes* Bless you! And sorry, I think I farted.

Bob: *laughs* No worries, happens to the best of us. *blushes* Um, would you like some tissues?

Alice: Yes, please. *kisses* Thank you. You always know how to make me feel better.

Bob: *smiles* Anything for you. *yawns* Sorry, I didn't sleep well last night.

Alice: It's okay. *goosebumps* Did you feel that draft?

Bob: Yeah, it's giving me the chills. *sweats* And it's making me sweat, too.

Alice: *winces* Are you in pain?

Bob: Yeah, my back's been acting up lately. *gags* Ugh, the smell of that food is making me nauseous.

Alice: *sighs* Maybe we should go somewhere else to eat.

Bob: *snoring* Sorry, did I fall asleep?

Alice: *faints* Oh no, I think I just fainted.

Bob: *cries* Alice, wake up! *trembles* Are you okay?

Alice: *gasping* I couldn't breathe for a moment there. *hiccup* And now I have the hiccups.

Bob: *vomits* Oh no, I think that food didn't agree with me.

Alice: *faints* Again?

Bob: *shivers* Yeah, I think I caught a chill.

Alice: *chewing* Let's eat something else before we both get sick.

Bob: *spasms* Agreed. *sniffs* I think I'm allergic to something here.

Alice: Let's get out of here before things get worse. *breathes deeply*

Bob: *blinks* Yeah, good idea. *sobbing* I'm sorry our date turned out like this.

Alice: *snaps* It's not your fault. *groans* Let's just get through this together.

Bob: *frowns* I hate seeing you in pain. *sniffs* Are you feeling any better?

Alice: *smiles weakly* A little. Thanks for being here for me.

========

Bob: Hey, are you feeling okay? You look a bit flushed.

Alice: Yeah, I think I caught a cold. *sniff* I can't stop sneezing.

Bob: *laughs* Well, you sound like a symphony of sneezes. Bless you!

Alice: *blushes* Thanks. Ugh, and I can't seem to stop coughing either.

Bob: Maybe you should sit down. You're starting to tremble.

Alice: I'm fine. Just a little chilly. *yawns*

Bob: You should bundle up. I don't want you getting goosebumps.

Alice: Too late for that. And I'm sweating, too.

Bob: Are you in pain? You're gripping your stomach.

Alice: Yeah, I think it's something I ate. I might gag.

Bob: Don't faint on me! Here, have some water. And try not to vomit.

Alice: Thanks. *sips* Ugh, I feel like I might suffocate.

Bob: Take deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth.

Alice: *hiccup* Sorry, it's not helping. *gags*

Bob: Maybe you're allergic to something. Let me get you some tissues.

Alice: *sniffs* Thanks. I think I need to lie down.

Bob: Don't faint on me now. I can't carry you.

Alice: *laughs weakly* I won't. But I might cry.

Bob: It's okay to cry. Just don't forget to breathe.

Alice: *sobs* I won't. *sniffles* My eyes hurt.

Bob: Maybe you should blink more. And try not to sob too hard.

Alice: *groans* I feel terrible.

Bob: It's okay. I'm here for you. *frowns*

Alice: *smiles weakly* Thanks. You always know how to make me feel better.

Bob: *chews on his lip* I just hate seeing you like this.

Alice: *sniffles* I know. *sighs* But I'll be okay. *snaps eyes shut*

Bob: Just rest. I'll be right here.
