The following cmavo are discussed in this section:

<table class="cmavo-list"><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr class="cmavo-entry"><td class="cmavo"><p class="cmavo">da'o</p></td><td class="selmaho"><p class="selmaho">DAhO</p></td><td class="description"><p class="description">cancel all pro-sumti/pro-bridi</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<a id="id-1.8.15.4.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.4.2" class="indexterm"></a>How long does a pro-sumti or pro-bridi remain stable? In other words, once we know the referent of a pro-sumti or pro-bridi, how long can we be sure that future uses of the same cmavo have the same referent? The answer to this question depends on which series the cmavo belongs to.

<a id="id-1.8.15.5.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.5.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.5.3" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.5.4" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.5.5" class="indexterm"></a>Personal pro-sumti are stable until there is a change of speaker or listener, possibly signaled by a vocative. Assignable pro-sumti and pro-bridi last indefinitely or until rebound with _<a id="id-1.8.15.5.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_goi_](../go01#valsi-goi)_ or _<a id="id-1.8.15.5.7.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_cei_](../go01#valsi-cei)_. Bound variable pro-sumti and pro-bridi also generally last until re-bound; details are available in [Section 16.14](../section-notes-on-variables).

<a id="id-1.8.15.6.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.6.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.6.3" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.6.4" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.6.5" class="indexterm"></a>Utterance pro-sumti are stable only within the utterance in which they appear; similarly, reflexive pro-sumti are stable only within the bridi in which they appear; and _<a id="id-1.8.15.6.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_ke'a_](../go01#valsi-keha)_ is stable only within its relative clause. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi are stable only within narrow limits depending on the rules for the particular cmavo.

<a id="id-1.8.15.7.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.7.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.7.3" class="indexterm"></a>Demonstrative pro-sumti, indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi, and sumti and bridi questions potentially change referents every time they are used.

<a id="id-1.8.15.8.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.8.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.8.3" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.8.4" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.8.5" class="indexterm"></a>However, there are ways to cancel all pro-sumti and pro-bridi, so that none of them have known referents. (Some, such as _<a id="id-1.8.15.8.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_mi_](../go01#valsi-mi)_, will acquire the same referent as soon as they are used again after the cancellation.) The simplest way to cancel everything is with the cmavo _<a id="id-1.8.15.8.7.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da'o_](../go01#valsi-daho)_ of selma'o DAhO, which is used solely for this purpose; it may appear anywhere, and has no effect on the grammar of texts containing it. One use of _<a id="id-1.8.15.8.8.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_da'o_](../go01#valsi-daho)_ is when entering a conversation, to indicate that one's pro-sumti assignments have nothing to do with any assignments already made by other participants in the conversation.

<a id="id-1.8.15.9.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.9.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.9.3" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.8.15.9.4" class="indexterm"></a>In addition, the cmavo _<a id="id-1.8.15.9.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_ni'o_](../go01#valsi-niho)_ and _<a id="id-1.8.15.9.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_no'i_](../go01#valsi-nohi)_ of selma'o NIhO, which are used primarily to indicate shifts in topic, may also have the effect of canceling pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignments, or of reinstating ones formerly in effect. More explanations of NIhO can be found in [Section 19.3](../section-niho).
