<a id="id-1.18.9.2.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.18.9.2.2" class="indexterm"></a>Lojban does not have punctuation marks as such: the denpa bu and the slaka bu are really a part of the alphabet. Other languages, however, use punctuation marks extensively. As yet, Lojban does not have any words for these punctuation marks, but a mechanism exists for devising them: the cmavo _<a id="id-1.18.9.2.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_lau_](../go01#valsi-lau)_ of selma'o LAU. _<a id="id-1.18.9.2.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_lau_](../go01#valsi-lau)_ must always be followed by a BY word; the interpretation of the BY word is changed from a lerfu to a punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would be a cmevla or brivla with a _<a id="id-1.18.9.2.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu_](../go01#valsi-bu)_ suffix.

<a id="id-1.18.9.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>Why is _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_lau_](../go01#valsi-lau)_ necessary at all? Why not just use a _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu_](../go01#valsi-bu)_ -marked word and announce that it is always to be interpreted as a punctuation mark? Primarily to avoid ambiguity. The _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu_](../go01#valsi-bu)_ mechanism is extremely open-ended, and it is easy for Lojban users to make up _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.5.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_bu_](../go01#valsi-bu)_ words without bothering to explain what they mean. Using the _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.6.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_lau_](../go01#valsi-lau)_ cmavo flags at least the most important of such nonce lerfu words as having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same argument applies to the use of _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.7.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_zai_](../go01#valsi-zai)_ to signal an alphabet shift or _<a id="id-1.18.9.3.8.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_ce'a_](../go01#valsi-ceha)_ to signal a font shift.)

<a id="id-1.18.9.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>Since different alphabets require different punctuation marks, the interpretation of a _<a id="id-1.18.9.4.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>[_lau_](../go01#valsi-lau)_ -marked lerfu word is affected by the current alphabet shift and the current font shift.
