------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a id="id-1.18.17.2.1" class="indexterm"></a>The following sections contain tables of proposed lerfu words for some of the standard alphabets supported by the Lojban lerfu system. The first column of each list is the lerfu (actually, a Latin-alphabet name sufficient to identify it). The second column is the proposed name-based lerfu word, and the third column is the proposed lerfu word in the system based on using the cmavo of selma'o BY with a shift word.

<a id="id-1.18.17.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>These tables are not meant to be authoritative (several authorities within the Lojban community have niggled over them extensively, disagreeing with each other and sometimes with themselves). They provide a working basis until actual usage is available, rather than a final resolution of lerfu word problems. Probably the system presented here will evolve somewhat before settling down into a final, conventional form.

For Latin-alphabet lerfu words, see [Section 17.2](../section-lerfu-liste) (for Lojban) and [Section 17.5](../section-alien-alphabets) (for non-Lojban Latin-alphabet lerfu).
