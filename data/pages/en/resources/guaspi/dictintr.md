This is the dictionary of the *gua\\spi* language. It is organized into
three parts in which words are ordered by *gua\\spi* spelling (with
morphological formats in separate sections), by the English translation,
and by thesaurus categories. The table of contents also serves as an
outline of the categories.

This edition includes only primitive words of *gua\\spi*. Only a few
compound words appear. A future project will be to go through a list of
the N most common English words and either to verify that each one has a
primitive translation or to recommend a compound representation of it.
Note the word \`\`recommend\'\'. The speaker of *gua\\spi* is expected
to represent his meaning by compounding primitive words creatively, and
the architect of *gua\\spi* does not insist on particular compound words
to translate particular English words.

But since the vocabulary of English is so vast, even the working
vocabulary of an educated person, most English words will never be in
this dictionary. Here is where the thesaurus can help. Look at the
primitive words in the category where your meaning is, and try to modify
one of them by compounding to achieve the meaning you want.

To get the most use out of *gua\\spi* you have to know all the primitive
words. For this the thesaurus can be helpful as it forms an organized
structure whose lists are a convenient size for memorization.

Be sure to remember that *gua\\spi* predicates can be converted. The
English word used in the definition is the one most representative of
the unconverted *gua\\spi* case order, but by conversion you can get up
to four additional English meanings.

In one trial of *Loglan* about half of the predicates were compound, and
likely more will be compound in *gua\\spi*. Be alert for creative
opportunities for expression \-\-- don\'t use only the words identified
as being \`\`common in compounds\'\'. But resist the temptation to
specify a predicate over-precisely with many compounded words; one
thinks differently in *gua\\spi*, and mashing *gua\\spi* words to fit
English preconceptions does not give the best results.

Acronyms, so popular in illiterate English, are useless in *gua\\spi*
because the letterals of the acronym are longer than the compound word
or phrase that they abbreviate. Again, keep the compound short.

An example of a definition is \`\`X1 likes to do (vo) X2+1\'\'. The
symbols X1 and X2 represent the first and second numbered cases of the
predicate \`\`like\'\'. Words in parentheses before the case symbols,
such as \`\`(vo)\'\', are provided by default before that argument
unless there is an explicit article there \-\-- which cancels both the
default article and the default phrase linker if any. All arguments
receive *\`\`xe\'\'* as a prefixed article by default, unless a
different article is shown in the dictionary or is said explicitly.
Signs following the case numbers indicate special features of compound
words and case merging in infinitives. Here they are illustrated
decorating the second case, but the same pattern applies for all cases.

X2\*
:   In a transitive compound (tone \`=\'), this is the case where the
    object goes. It is the second case by default (but the dictionary
    even so shows many X2\*\'s explicitly).

X2+1
:   In an infinitive compound (tone \`-\'), this is the case where the
    infinitive goes. Note that a few words do not do infinitive
    compounds (they do parallel compounds instead) even though they have
    a case for an infinitive. All cases of these words lack \`+\' or
    have \`@\'. The \`1\' selects the first case of the main predicate.
    This argument is replicated as the first case of the infinitive
    (whether explicit or from a compound). The notation \`\`+1,2\'\'
    means that referents from both cases are replicated. A \`+\' alone
    signals infinitive compounding but with no case replication.

X2-3
:   Usually used with a \`+\' decoration, the -3 means that the third
    case of the main predicate is replicated as the second case of the
    infinitive.

X2+S1
:   The \`S\' means that, X1 normally being a set, its members are
    replicated in extension into the first case of the infinitive.
    \`\`-S1\'\' is also used for the infinitive second case.

X2+P1
:   The \`P\' means that the infinitive is applied pairwise to members
    of the first case set, as in sorting or finding an extreme member.

X2+1@
:   The \`@\' indicates that this case is not eligible for infinitive
    compounds, though the indicated replication occurs for explicit
    infinitives.

X2=
:   The \`=\' means that starting with the indicated case (here X2), all
    following cases have a similar role, as many cases as needed. The
    sum of several numbers, as many as needed, is a typical example.

X2?
:   The \`?\' indicates a special case replication, described after the
    definition.

Here are the types of compounds. See the reference manual for a complete
explanation with examples.

Infinitive
:   The second word is the predicate of an infinitive in one of the
    first word\'s cases. (Tone \`-\'.)

Parallel
:   Both words share the same arguments so both relations are
    simultaneously true of each argument list. (Tone \`-\', or
    *\`\`-fe\'\'* if an infinitive compound would supervene.)

Transitive
:   The second word is the predicate of an argument in one of the first
    word\'s cases, the second case unless otherwise noted. (Tone \`=\'.)

Here is a reminder of the non-English letters of *gua\\spi*. See the
reference manual for more examples.
