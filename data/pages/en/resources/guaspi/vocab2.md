## Mathematical Expressions {#mathematical-expressions align="center"}

Even uneducated speakers quantify phrases, that is, they say how many or
how big some phrase is. It turns out that to support just simple
dimensioned quantities the language has to include a complete facility
for mathematical expressions.

### Numbers, Expressions and Functions {#numbers-expressions-and-functions align="center"}

Cardinal numbers (here exemplified by *\`\`cu\'\'* - set of two) are
defined as \`\`X1 is a set containing so many members X2\'\'. The
converted predicate means \`\`X2 is a member of a set X1 of so many
members\'\'. Quantifiers are subordinate clauses on an argument, e.g.

> *\^:i !cil \|zu -cu \^ji /fi -vyl*
>
> My twins are male

How do you say \`\`the number two\'\'? Any set with two members can be
put in 1-1 correspondence with any other such set, but not with a set
with different count; this forms an equivalence relation that segregates
sets by count. Among the ways to define \`\`the number two\'\' the one
that fits best in *gua\\spi* is *\`\`xu -cu\'\'*, designating this
equivalence class. All kinds of mathematical objects, such as rational,
real, complex and dimensioned numbers, can be produced by various
extension maneuvers from these equivalence classes, and can be named in
*gua\\spi* by *\`\`xu -N\'\'*.

> *!xu -cu -cw -ci*
>
> The number 2.5 (the class of all sets of \`\`count\'\' 2.5)

Mathematical functions are defined with such classes as formal
parameters, and hence have *\`\`xu\'\'* on parameter cases by
defaultÂ \-\-- *\`\`xu\'\'* means the entire referent set of an argument,
as a set (or class). The first case of a function is its value, and the
function is defined as \`\`X1 is in the equivalence class that comes
from doing (function) on (*xu*) X2\'\', possibly with several
parameters. Thus a function can be used to predicate that something has
a particular count or measure. *\`\`xu\'\'* recovers the equivalence
class. The abbreviation \`\`IEC\'\', meaning \`\`in equivalence
class\'\', is used thus: \`\`X1 IEC the result of (whatever)\'\'. For
example,

> *\^:i !xa -ca /plw !co \^cu*
>
> 3 is the sum of 1 and 2 (all triplets IEC 1+2)

This syntax for mathematical expressions is neat, compact and
unambiguous. No special syntax needs to be added to *gua\\spi* beyond
that already in use for ordinary arguments and sentences.

Functions always deliver their value in the first case and take
arguments in the second and following cases. For the range and domain of
a function F, use *\`\`xu -F\'\'* and *\`\`xu -zu -F\'\'* respectively.

### Ordinal Numbers and List Ends {#ordinal-numbers-and-list-ends align="center"}

An ordinal number, cued by the quasidigit *\`\`tr\'\'*, means \`\`X1 is
N\'th in list (*xy*) X2 starting at X3\'\'. For example:

> *\^:i -brn !junu !qnou =ji \|tio /ve -tr -ca*
>
> Broken is the third claw of my right paw (hand)

List ends and segments are built with \`\`*bny*-begin\'\' and
\`\`*fne*-end\'\' restricted by a numeric predicate. Note the
definition, \`\`X1 is the next or previous member of (xy) X2 after
X3\'\'; restrict with a numeric predicate to change to the N\'th next or
previous member. Without X3 the list ends are produced, but don\'t be
confused by the polarity: \`\`*bny*-next also means \`\`beginning\'\' or
\`\`least\'\' when the list is ordered by size or degree;
\`\`*fne*-previous\'\' means \`\`end\'\' or \`\`most\'\'. It is clearer
to use an ordinal number when you can. For example,

> *\^:i \|vi -pli \^jo /can -fne !psa -gvu*
>
> Please go to the end of the line
>
> *\^:i !ji /bny \|cu \^sty -kqa !diu -sui*
>
> I am the second smallest in the class
>
> *\^:i !ji /tr -cu !sty -kqa !diu -sui*
>
> Same thing, better
>
> *\^:i !bny \|te -ca \^sty -bir !kuo \|tum =teon \^ji /fi -za -gey
> \|jro \^su -xo -spia*
>
> The first three people (in order by time) to phone me will be given
> tickets
>
> *\^:i !tr -te -ca !sty -bir !kuo \|tum =teon \^ji /fi -za -gey \|jro
> \^su -xo -spia*
>
> Same thing, better

Lists are ordered with smaller or negative numbers first, so the
\`\`smallest\'\' is *\`\`bny -sty -kqa\'\'* whereas the largest would be
*\`\`fne -sty -kqa\'\'* or, sorting the list in reverse order, *\`\`/bny
!sty -spl\'\'*. See also the discussion of \`\`*sym*-chief\'\' under
[Comparative and Superlative](vocab2.html#sym-chief) for a better way to
do \`\`second smallest\'\' and the like.

### Vectors, Dates and Times {#vectors-dates-and-times align="center"}

You express a vector as a \`\`*stl*-list\'\' of expressions. Units of
measure applied to a vector multiply each component individually. A
matrix (by components) is a list of vectors, and so on. A date or time
is also a list of expressions.

> *\^:i !vnyn /zm -cmu !dman \^dmem !stl !ci \^ca -cy*
>
> The wind is (5, 30) meters per second (per second meter 5, 30)
>
> *\^:i !qo -kauai:i /jir !vdei !stl !co -ke \^kl -co -ci -ko*
>
> Hawaii is at (19, -156) degrees
>
> *\^:i -tem =jani !su -jn \^stl !co -ke -ka -ke \^cu \^co -ke*
>
> The date today is 2/19/1989 (order: year, month, day)
>
> *\^:i !qo -kamleto /zu -fom \|tem =qrau !stl !cu -cy \^ca -cy*
>
> Hamlet will be performed at 20:30 hours

The date is defined as \`\`X1 is the date of event (vo) X2+ starting
with unit (xu-jani) X3\* in calendar X4\'\' in which auto-conversion
lets it restrict a sentence directly, while the unit can still be
compounded. The first vector component has that unit, and subsequent
components are multiplied by sub-units in the order years, months, days,
hours, minutes, seconds. The default unit is \`\`*jani*-years\'\'.

### Units of Measure {#units-of-measure align="center"}

Units of measure are defined to multiply a number or other expression by
the unit. The resulting equivalence class is considered to contain
*gua\\spi* events whose degree or measure are that big; hence the unit
expression takes the form of a subordinate clause, and the main sentence
predicate tells what dimension is being measured. For example,

> *\^:i !ji /vga \|kyam !ku -cy*
>
> I weigh 70 kilos (I heavy kilo 7 0)
>
> *\^:i !tor =cenu /cni !ti -kl -co -cw -cu -ka -kn -ku*
>
> The account balance is about minus 12.8 million dollars (\$ about
> -1.28E7)

\`\`Scientific notation\'\' is used in *gua\\spi* instead of the
thousands and millions typical of English and in place of the metric
prefixes; it is more compact and much easier to specify syntactically.

This definition of a unit is reasonable mathematically since a physical
unit of measure can be interpreted as a basis member of a 1-dimensional
vector space of things having that dimension. For example, consider
mass. Take the set of all things with mass, and take equivalence classes
of things with equal mass. Those equivalence classes occupy, and can be
extended to create, a 1-D vector space. Any single member is a basis,
and a unit is a member selected by convention, e.g. *the* standard
kilogram. Now for the word, its referent could be the unit, but you have
to multiply it by the number (e.g. 2.5 times grams), which makes
expressions too wordy. So the unit word is defined as a math function
that multiplies by the unit.

In units of measure, the first argument occupants are not things but
properties, e.g. masses of things, which are events, e.g. \`\`something
is massive\'\'. The need for a predicate to go with the thing being
measured is easiest to see in 3-D, e.g. the argument could be high, wide
or deep but all are measured by the single dimension of meters. Then the
unit becomes a modal case of the predicate. These examples show how to
use MKS and provincial units:

> *\^:i !ji /gal \|dmem !co-cw-ku-ce*
>
> I am 1.74 meters high
>
> *\^:i !ji /gal \|xnu -fn -:inca !ko-ke*
>
> I am 69 inches high

In particular, no quantifiable relation (e.g. \`\`heavy\'\' or
\`\`exceeds in dimension *vo* X3\'\') has an explicit case for how much
it is, relying instead on the modal case of units. There is one
exception: \`\`*kun*-quantity\'\' is like a unit in providing a modal
case for quantity, but provides an identity transformation, so that a
question word can be dropped into the multiplicand argument without
forcing a specific unit.

To talk about the unit rather than to use it, use *\`\`xu vo
\<unit\>\'\'*, as in \`\`the pound is a provincial unit\'\'. *\`\`xe vo
\<unit\>\'\'* will deliver the standard unit, if there is one, given
suitable context cues.

Compound units, like ohms, require a product or quotient of several
units. One may use the personal name units (ohm, volt, pascal, celsius)
in the same manner as provincial units.

### Nine Varieties of Negation {#nine-varieties-of-negation align="center"}

*\^:i [-sfa]{.underline} !kio !ji \^tara \|zey !ju*
:   *It is false* that I have your rat. This is the prototype of
    negation, and it is the policy in *gua\\spi* to use predicates when
    possible rather than prefixes or other structure words. However, the
    negated sentence is an extra level down, a problem for speakers.

*\^:i [-go]{.underline} !ji /kio !tara \|zey !ju*
:   I *don\'t* have your rat. *\`\`go\'\'* is a mood prefix which means
    that the asserted sentence is counter to fact. It is simpler and
    more familiar to natural language speakers than \`\`*sfa*-false\'\'
    is, and it works in subordinate clauses where *\`\`sfa\'\'*
    doesn\'t.

*\^:i !ji /kio !tara [\|go]{.underline} -zey !ju*
:   I have a rat which *isn\'t* yours. *\`\`go\'\'* can equally be used
    in subordinate clauses, or even in argument predicates.

*\^:i !ji /kio [!xn]{.underline} -kseo*
:   I have *no* cheese. *\`\`xn\'\'* means that of the members of the
    full referent set of the argument, none fit in the predicated
    relation. Unlike the rest of the articles, this is actually a
    statement about the excluded members, and means the same as
    *\`\`\^:i !ji [/go]{.underline} -kio !xa -kseo\'\'*Â \-\-- freely
    translated, \`\`for all pieces of cheese, I don\'t have it\'\'. (See
    De Morgan\'s rules below.)

*\^:i !ji /kio !kseo [\|zu -cy]{.underline}*
:   I have *zero* pieces of cheese. This is the most natural form of
    argument negation in *Loglan*, but *gua\\spi* looks strictly at
    referent sets, and if you say you have all the members of the null
    set, it isn\'t a cheesy null setÂ \-\-- there is only one null set.
    The statement is a tautology, and says nothing about cheese. Many
    logical fallacies, such as St. Anselm\'s ontological proof of the
    existence of God, are like this example in that they prove a
    statement about the members of a set which may not have any members.
    In *gua\\spi* use *\`\`xn\'\'* as above.

*\^:i !ji /kio [!ple]{.underline} !tara*
:   I have something which *isn\'t* the rat. The full referent set of
    *\`\`ple !xe -tara\'\'* (and therefore its referent subset) is in
    the complement of the referent subset of *\`\`xe -tara\'\'*.

*\^:i !jw \|kseo /fi [-stu]{.underline} -zao*
:   This cheese is *bad* in flavor. In George Orwell\'s 1984, the
    language \`\`newspeak\'\' was designed to destroy the ability of
    people to think, and one of its design features was that negative
    words were eliminated; \`\`bad\'\' became \`\`ungood\'\'. *Gua\\spi*
    (imitating *Loglan*) offers specific negated words for major
    predicates when the negations are used frequently. Nonetheless, most
    negations will have to be done with compound words as in the next
    examples. Be alert for creative expression possibilities such as
    *\`\`\^:i !jw \|kseo !fu [-zu -dyi]{.underline}\'\'*Â \-\-- \`\`this
    cheese is *disgusting*\'\'.

*\^:i !jw \|kseo !fu [/gl]{.underline} -zao*
:   This cheese is flavor*less*. Many dimensions are quantifiable (more
    or less) but unsigned, so their degree ranges from zero to larger
    values. This is how to assert that the degree is zero or negligible.

*\^:i !jw \|kseo !fu [/gr]{.underline} -ksi*
:   This cheese is *not* fresh. When the dimension ranges from positive
    to negative values, *\`\`gr\'\'* interchanges positive and negative.
    On occasion, *\`\`gl\'\'* will also apply to indicate the zero
    point, though it is meaningless with \`\`*ksi*-fresh\'\'. For
    extremes of unfreshness one can use \`\`*fpu*-rotten\'\'.

*\^:i !jw \|kseo /fi [-vry]{.underline} -can -psl*
:   This cheese is *de*solidifying. When a process occurs in the reverse
    of the usual order, \`\`*vry*-reverse\'\' indicates this.

### De Morgan\'s Rules in Quantification {#de-morgans-rules-in-quantification align="center"}

Negation interacts with \`\`and\'\' and \`\`or\'\', which necessarily
occur in sentences which are quantified or whose arguments have multiple
referents. Therefore it is advisable to digress into some elementary
symbolic logic. Here is De Morgan\'s rule for negation, stated four
ways: (A and B are sentences)

> A
>
> and
>
> B
>
> Â Â Â Â = not(
>
> (not A)
>
> or
>
> (not B))
>
> (not A)
>
> and
>
> (not B)
>
> Â Â Â Â = not(
>
> A
>
> or
>
> B\)
>
> A
>
> or
>
> B
>
> Â Â Â Â = not(
>
> (not A)
>
> and
>
> (not B))
>
> (not A)
>
> or
>
> (not B)
>
> Â Â Â Â = not(
>
> A
>
> and
>
> B\)

Remember that in logic, \`\`A or B\'\' is true if one or *both* of the
statements is true, unlike in English where the \`\`or\'\' generally
excludes both being true.

Universal quantification means a statement is true when applied to all
members of a set, of the form \`\`S1 and S2 and S3 andÂ .Â .Â .\'\', where
S1 is the statement applied to member 1 and so on. Existential
quantification means that a statement is true about at least one set
member, in form \`\`S1 or S2 or S3 orÂ .Â .Â .\'\' When such statements are
negated, De Morgan\'s rule applies. Here are some more specific
examples.

*\^:i -kio !ji \^kseo*
:   I have the cheese. This will be the basic example sentence. Let us
    make the existential quantification more explicit:

*\^:i -kio !ji \^kseo \|zu -to*
:   I have at least one piece of cheese. Existential quantification like
    this means the same as \`\`I have piece 1 *or* I have piece 2
    *or*Â .Â .Â .\'\' for all pieces of cheese. Now the simplest negation
    of this sentence is simply:

*\^:i -sfa !kio !ji \^kseo \|zu -to*
:   It is false that I have at least one piece of cheese. This form does
    not suit typical speakers; we want to negate the relation word
    \`\`*kio*-possess\'\', not the whole sentence, like this:

*\^:i !ji [/go]{.underline} -kio !xa -kseo*
:   I don\'t have any cheeseÂ \-\-- I don\'t have piece 1 *and* I don\'t
    have piece 2 *and*Â .Â .Â . To negate (or de-negate) a disjunction
    (compound sentence with \`\`or\'\'), we had to change \`\`or\'\' to
    \`\`and\'\', producing a universal quantification. The same
    principle applies when you start with a universal:

*\^:i !xa -xe -cil /jir*
:   All the children are hereÂ \-\-- Child 1 is here *and* child 2 is
    here *and*Â .Â .Â . Rather than negating the whole sentence with
    \`\`*sfa*-false\'\', let us negate the predicate \`\`*jir*-here\'\':

*\^:i -go -jir !cil [\|zu -to]{.underline}*
:   At least one of the children is not hereÂ \-\-- Child 1 is not here
    *or* child 2 is not here *or*Â .Â .Â . In general, when you negate the
    predicate of a sentence involving quantification or multiple
    argument referents of any kind, you will also have to reverse the
    type of quantification or conjunction used.

## Sentence Forms {#sentence-forms align="center"}

### Moods and Imperatives {#moods-and-imperatives align="center"}

These are the mood prefixes in *gua\\spi*, which indicate the manner of
assertion of a phrase. A top level sentence has *\`\`ge\'\'* on it by
default unless another mood prefix appears.

> *ge*
>
> Asserted to be real or factual
>
> *\^:i !vo [-ge]{.underline} -dae !kara !fu -bal !crw \|jro \^tara
> \^kseo*
>
> If the box is open, *which it is,* then the rat could eat the cheese
>
> *gi*
>
> Potentially true; actual truth is irrelevant
>
> *\^:i !vo -ge -dae !kara !fu -bal [!gi]{.underline} -crw \|jro \^tara
> \^kseo*
>
> If the box is open then the rat *could* eat the cheese
>
> *go*
>
> Unreal or counter to fact
>
> *\^:i [-go]{.underline} !ji /kio !tara \|zey !ju*
>
> I *don\'t* have your rat
>
> *gu*
>
> Hypothetical; reality is irrelevant
>
> *\^:i !ji [/gu]{.underline} -fli \^:o -sar [!gu]{.underline} -vlw !ji
> \^qyun*
>
> If I *could* fly I *would* go to the moon

Closely related to the mood prefixes is the aspect operator
\`\`*tri*-ritual\'\', a sign of a performative phrase.
\`\`Performative\'\' means that by uttering the words the speaker makes
something true, as in a marriage vow or the illustrated naming ceremony.
Note that auto-conversion is suppressed by *\`\`zo\'\'*; without it, the
sentence would merely be the topic of a ceremony, not the ceremony
itself.

> *\^:i [\|zo -tri]{.underline} \^qo -ben /zu -xim !jw \|cil*
>
> (Performative:) Ben is the name of this child

In English there is an imperative mood; however, in *gua\\spi* you make
a sentence imperative by using \`\`*jo*-you\'\' or \`\`*ja*-we\'\' in
the case for the actor, generally the first. These pronouns are
distinguished from the non-imperative \`\`*ju*-you\'\' and
\`\`*je*-we\'\'. A decoration \`\`*pli*-please\'\' softens the command.
For example,

> *\^:i \|faw \^vu -qnu !qo -josefo /jo /qma -duw !gunu !ju*
>
> Josepho, move your ass!
>
> *\^:i \|vi -pli \^jo /pin -dwo*
>
> Please be patient.

### Special Features of Infinitives {#special-features-of-infinitives align="center"}

In an infinitive the previous argument is replicated by default as the
infinitive\'s first argument, while the first argument of a subordinate
clause comes normally from the restricted phrase. Hence numbered cases
skip over the first argument, and you must use the caselink *\`\`so\'\'*
for any explicit first case in an infinitive or subordinate clause. In
an infinitive with *\`\`vo\'\'* a predicate is made out of the
sub-sentence that follows, including arguments and clauses. In the rare
case where a sub-phrase (like a subordinate clause) must go on the
infinitive predicate rather than into the sub-sentence, you can put a
prefix before *\`\`vo\'\'*, like an article, and put the clause between
the article and *\`\`vo\'\'*.

When an infinitive with *\`\`vo\'\'* is an argument, the main sentence
asserts the relation of arguments to the infinitive\'s events, but does
not make a separate assertion of those events. To additionally assert or
deny the sub-phrase, use *\`\`ge\'\'* or *\`\`go\'\'* respectively. For
example:

> *\^:i !qo -kira /juy -xna !do \^qnou !xgno*
>
> Kira allows it to hold his hand (offersÂ \-\-- but instead it swims
> awayÂ \-\-- infinitive not asserted)
>
> *\^:i !do /qou !qo -kira \^ge -qma -za -pai !cana \^ve -tum =tuen*
>
> It watches as Kira bails (drains) the boat with a bucket (infinitive
> is also asserted)

### [Comparative and Superlative]{#sym-chief} {#comparative-and-superlative align="center"}

Natural languages have various complicated arrangements to change a
simple property to become comparative or superlative. *Gua\\spi* does it
with a predicate.

> *\^:i !X1 /qaw -xgi !X2*
>
> X1 is equally green as X2
>
> *\^:i !X1 /gre -xgi !X2*
>
> X1 is more green than X2
>
> *\^:i !X1 /sym -xgi !X2*
>
> X1 is (one of) the greenest member(s) of set X2

In the case of \`\`*sym*-superlative\'\' it is possible for several
members to be equally green, each being greener than the remaining
members. Also, a numeric predicate modifying *\`\`sym\'\'* produces the
N\'th greenest member. Here are some sentences with comparatives and
superlatives:

> *\^:i !star -fn -siriu \^qo -prosyon /gre -xgm*
>
> The star Sirius is brighter than Procyon
>
> *\^:i !qo -jupiter /sym -kqa !stel*
>
> Jupiter is the largest planet
>
> *\^:i !qo -siriu /sym -xgm \|cu \^xu -star \|vu -sen !zu -jrer \\hfil\
> \^:i !qo -siriu /fne \|cu \^sty -xgm !xu -star*
>
> Sirius is the second brightest of all stars, as seen from Earth (two
> ways)
>
> *\^:i !qo -siriu /sym -xgm !tei !star \^qo -sol*
>
> Sirius is the brightest star except for the Sun

### Causal Sentence Connectives {#causal-sentence-connectives align="center"}

*\^:i !tara /crw !kseo \^:o [-kau]{.underline} !gai -tuol !kseo*
:   The rat eats the cheese, and that *causes* it to be dirty. A cause
    is rather mechanical. Actors with free will are rarely caused to do
    anything, despite their protestations. Here the rat may have free
    will, but the cheese, caused to be dirty, certainly does not.

*\^:i !ji /gri !tara \^kai \|kei \^kseo \^:o [-kmo]{.underline} !qma -qtu !ji \^tara*
:   I am angry at the rat for stealing the cheese, which *motivates* me
    to kill the rat. The theft motivates the anger and the anger
    motivates the planned killing. When a free agent acts it is usually
    because of a motivation. Here the speaker includes
    \`\`*kei*-crime\'\' in the sentence as a justification for his
    action. The definition of this word reminds you that it has the
    modal case \`\`*tue*-culture\'\', which presumably includes the
    speakerÂ \-\-- but not the rat.

*\^:i !xi -tara /qai -crw \|jro \^kseo \^:o [-zu -zni]{.underline} !vel !klo \^kseo*
:   So that rats cannot eat the cheese, is the *reason* the cheese is in
    a closed container. A reason is an end (ending event) or consequence
    that *motivates* someone to make a starting event happen, such as
    keeping the cheese in the box, that will *cause* the consequence.
    The concept of \`\`*zni*-reason\'\' is rather slippery. First, the
    desired or planned consequence should be stated, not its inverse;
    *\`\`\^:i !xo -tara /gi -crw !kseo\'\'* = \`\`A rat might eat the
    cheese\'\' is the negative of the correct consequence. Second, we
    say in English \`\`past event Y is the reason for action Z\'\' where
    the *gua\\spi* definition of \`\`*zni*-reason\'\' requires
    \`\`vengeance for past event Y\'\'Â \-\-- a future consequence of
    action Z. *\`\`vou\'\'* = \`\`vengeance\'\'. Third, a
    \`\`*gul*-rule\'\' can be said to *cause* its reason, provided the
    obligees obey it.

*\^:i -dae !kara \^:o [-sny]{.underline} !pwo -cyr -xyn !xi -tara \^kara*
:   The box being open *implies* that a rat can go into it. The relation
    of logical entailment has to do with definitions and theorems, not
    with the arrangement of the real world or the will of its actors.
    \`\`*zny*-imply\'\' is the corresponding set operator: \`\`X1 is the
    union of X2 and the complement of X3\'\', where X2 and X3 can be
    infinitives with *\`\`vo\'\'*. Perhaps the distinction between
    *\`\`sny\'\'* and *\`\`zny\'\'* is merely an artifact of old
    *Loglan* and English usage. We shall see if this is true as
    *gua\\spi* matures.

*\^:i -dae !kara \^:o [-bal]{.underline} !crw \|jro \^tara \^kseo*
:   If the box is open *then maybe* the rat will eat the cheese. This
    kind of fuzzy inference based on real-world consequences is what
    people use most often, rather than pure logic.

*\^:i !ji [/gu]{.underline} -fli \^:o [-sar !gu]{.underline} -vlw !ji \^qyun*
:   *If* I could fly I *would* go to the moon. Necessary conditions are
    very commonly expressed and the logical \`\`if-then\'\' catches
    their true meaning poorly. Related is \`\`*sno*-sufficient\'\'.

These are the sentence connectives most often seen. But the speaker may
connect sentences with any useful word having suitable cases. And like
all *gua\\spi* words, the sentence connectives can also be useful as
arguments and as modal caselinks.

### Logical Sentence Connectives {#logical-sentence-connectives align="center"}

Old *Loglan* was intended to be a \`\`logical language\'\', thereby to
differ as much as possible from English. Therefore, one of its key
features is support for what amounts to spoken symbolic logic. This
feature is de-emphasized in *gua\\spi*; in practice, what language users
encounter most often, and stumble over, are Cartesian expansion of
multiple arguments, non-commutative quantification, and complicated
negations. These topics are well-supported in *gua\\spi*. Nonetheless,
set arithmetic can be performed on infinitives and the result is a set
of events to which the listener\'s attention is drawn, just as with a
more normal sentence. The logician\'s \`\`if-then\'\' can be realized
through *\`\`zny\'\'*. Here are some examples of logical sentence
connectives:

> *\^:i [!xun]{.underline} !vo !ji /crw !ftu =plyw /vo !ji /crw !ftu
> =peir*
>
> I eat an apple *or* I eat a pear (or both, per logic)
>
> *\^:i !ji /crw !ftu [!xun]{.underline} !plyw \^peir*
>
> I eat a fruit of the apple *or* pear tree (better sentence)
>
> *\^:i [!zny]{.underline} !vo !xa -fma /zu -bor !cy /vo !fma /bor !jy*
>
> *If* a shape has void boundary *then* it is itself the boundary of
> something

## Features of Thesaurus Categories {#features-of-thesaurus-categories align="center"}

The *gua\\spi* words have been put into groups with related meanings,
for ease of learning and for ease of creation. The dictionary includes a
thesaurus of these categories. Many categories have closely related
cases, or certain special features, which are described below.

### Abstract Comparisons {#abstract-comparisons align="center"}

Many abstract comparisons (1.1.1) and set member words (1.1.3) include a
dimension on which comparison occurs. In a compound with the dimension
as sub-word, its cases merge in an unusual manner. Considering the
dimension to be single-ended (e.g. a color, as opposed to a directional
property), its first case is applied to several arguments as noted in
the definitions, e.g.

> *\^:i !X1 /qaw -xgi !X2*
>
> X1 is equally green as X2
>
> *\^:i !X1 /gre -xgi !X2*
>
> X1 is more green than X2
>
> *\^:i !X1 /sym -xgi !X2*
>
> X1 is (one of) the greenest member(s) of set X2

\`\`*xgi*-green\'\' is applied to both X1 and X2 in the first and second
sentence. This is described as a \`\`dual merge\'\'. In the last
sentence, \`\`*xgi*-green\'\' is applied to X1 and to members of X2. The
dictionary indicates all these special merges.

\`\`*stl*-list\'\' involves a dimension which is applied pairwise to
members of the list, indicating the ordering.

\`\`*qaw*-equally\'\' has a very unusual definition: the first case is
an infinitive into whose first case the rest of the cases are copied in
turn; the predicate means that all the arguments fit in the infinitive
equally. Normally the predicate of this infinitive is provided by
compounding, as in the example above.

### Sets {#sets align="center"}

For several words in category 1.1.2 (sets) of the form \`\`(set) X1 is a
(whatever)\'\', you can make a compound *\`\`vdr =W\'\'* to get the
members.

When *\`\`xy\'\'* (in-mind set) is the default article for a case, then
if the referents are sets the default changes automatically to
*\`\`xe\'\'* (in-mind in extension). But *\`\`xu\'\'* (whole set) does
not change to *\`\`xa\'\'* (same in extension) because in math functions
the usual occupant of such a case is supposed to be a set of equal-count
sets.

The predicates \`\`*tla*-set\'\' and \`\`*stl*-list\'\' have a special
arrangement of cases. They mean \`\`X1 is a set (in extension) or list
(ordered) consisting of members X2, X3, X4, Â .Â .Â .\'\', as many cases as
needed. If X2 etc. have multiple referents in extension (which must be
ordered for *\`\`stl\'\'*), all referents go in the set or list. Five or
six words have this \`\`as many as needed\'\' argument list.

### Properties {#properties align="center"}

Noncomparative Properties are distinguished in *Loglan* from the
Comparative Properties in that it is not useful to say that X is more
\<whatever\> than Y; for example, X is more dead than Y. For this reason
*Loglan* Comparative Properties each have a case for the compared item
and Noncomparative Properties do not. Nonetheless, many of its members
may actually be used comparatively (like \`\`*ksu*-delicious\'\') and
the distinction is rather artificial. In *gua\\spi*, Properties do not
have comparative arguments.

Directional Properties (1.5): These are often compounded with motion
words, in which the moving case is related to the destination. (Special
case: \`\`*tai*-outside\'\' merges with the start point. Examples in
\`\`Compound Words\'\'.) Note that the polarity (e.g. up/down) in such
compounds is often backwards from English.

Timelike Directional Properties (1.5.3): These are the relation words
for the tense modal case.

### Behaviors {#behaviors align="center"}

Abstract Behaviors(2.1): These have the form \`\`X1 does (vo) X2+1\'\',
in which X1 is automatically replicated as the first case of the
infinitive *\`\`vo X2\'\'*.

Double Actor Transitive Activities (2.1.3): These have the prototype
\`\`X1 makes X2 do (vo) X3+2\'\', in which X2 is automatically
replicated as the first case of *\`\`vo X3\'\'*.

Games for Two Players (2.1.4): Generally you will want to use a
reciprocal construction like this, unless the relation really is
unilateral:

> *\^:i !qo -jan \^fe -qo -mery /kul !vr -zdmo*
>
> John and Mary kissed each other

Motion Words (2.2): The prototype is \`\`X1 goes to X2 (destination)
from X3 (start point) via X4 (route)\'\'. Since motion words are
complicated, effort has been put in to make them all regular. They are
very frequently combined with directional properties, q.v.

Transitive Motion Words (2.2.3): The prototype is \`\`X1 makes X2 go to
X3 from X4 via X5\'\', and again they are all regular. Directional
properties relate X2, the mover, with X3, the start point.

Quasi-motions and Routes (2.2.4): The routes are set up as regular
motion words. The quasi-motions can profitably be compounded with motion
words.

Communication and Mental Activity (2.3): The pattern \`\`X1 knows that
X2 is (vo) X3+2\'\' is common, with X2 merging as the first case of X3.
However, quite a few predicates in this category have different
patterns, so watch out.

Transitive Activities with an Object (2.4): A number of these words have
an X3 case for a tool or means which is typically filled by a transitive
compound, as in:

> *\^:i !ji /fey =cuem !kliw*
>
> I pound on the nail (hammer hit)

### Things and Materials {#things-and-materials align="center"}

Animals and Plants (3.1): These have just one argument. The animals and
plants category has been extended to include a primitive for each
phylum, or at least most of them.

Body Parts (3.2): These have the prototype \`\`X1 is a (part) of
creature X2\*\'\'.

Materials (3.3): Almost all of these are of the form \`\`(xo) X1 is a
serving/portion of (material)\'\'. The *\`\`xo\'\'* appears by default
when the word is used as an argument, unless the containing sentence
provides a default article other than the usual *\`\`xe\'\'*.

Places, Seasons and Weather (3.5): Places mostly have the form \`\`X1 is
a (place) of locality or superset X2\'\'.

Containers (4.1.1) and Cooking and Eating (4.1.2): These have the form
\`\`X1 is a container containing (xo) X2\*\'\'. Constructions like
\`\`spoonful\'\' are handled with \`\`*ful*-contained quantity\'\', like
this:

> *\^:i !ji /crw !ze -kme \|ful =spun*
>
> I take a spoonful of medicine

Transport (4.1.4), Machines (4.1.5), and Parts of Structures (4.1.7):
Many of these are like body parts: \`\`X1 is a (part) of structure
X2\*\'\'.

Houses (4.1.8): House parts are as above. Houses themselves have the
form \`\`X1 is a (house) of resident X2\*\'\'.

Cloth and Parts of Clothes (4.2.2): Parts are as above. Cloth has the
form \`\`(xo) X1 is a portion of (cloth)\'\'.

Food (4.3): Mostly of the form \`\`(xo) X1 is a serving/portion of
(food)\'\'.

Works of Art (4.4.1): All have the form \`\`X1 is a (thing) about X2
created by X3 and performed by X4\'\'. X2 may be an event or a thing;
there is no *\`\`vo\'\'* default. X4 is present only on relevant words
such as \`\`*jiul*-drama\'\'.

### Miscellaneous Categories {#miscellaneous-categories align="center"}

Nationalities (4.7.1): *Loglan* has words for nationalities, for the
languages spoken there, and for the basis money unit of the nation. But
only about fifteen arbitrarily chosen nations are supported, mainly
European ones. *Gua\\spi* uses foreign names for these concepts, through
\`\`*zina*-nation\'\', \`\`*gua*-language\'\', and \`\`*cni*-money\'\'.
\`\`*spi*-person\'\' translates the usual self-referential word in
primitive languages for ethnic members of that culture.

Business (4.7.3): A number of these words have the form \`\`X1 (sells)
goods or services X2 to other trader X3 for amount of money (xu) X4\'\'.

## Most Frequent Words {#most-frequent-words align="center"}

So far, the corpus of *gua\\spi* text available for analysis consists of
3140 words of fiction representing a teenager setting up a small
business and interacting with younger children, parents, customers and
girlfriend. I originally wrote this story in *Loglan* to test various
features, and it is known that word frequencies will differ in other
topics. However, this text gives some guidance about which words a
beginner should be sure to learn.
