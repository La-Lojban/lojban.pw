> Abstract: *Gua\\spi* is an artificial language suited to both humans
> and machines. It can express real human conversation. Yet the
> vocabulary and the grammar are two and three orders of magnitude
> simpler than English. Word and phrase meanings are defined through
> predicate calculus and hence can be represented and manipulated
> efficiently and unambiguously by programs (and people).
