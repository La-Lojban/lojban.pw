# _Gua\spi_ Index

### James F. Carter

> Abstract: _Gua\spi_ is an artificial language suited to both humans and machines. It can express real human conversation. Yet the vocabulary and the grammar are two and three orders of magnitude simpler than English. Word and phrase meanings are defined through predicate calculus and hence can be represented and manipulated efficiently and unambiguously by programs (and people).
