What does **go'i** really mean?

== 5.9 ==

```
The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as pro-bridi, providing a reference to the content of other bridi; none of them has a fixed meaning. The most commonly used member of GOhA is probably go'i , which amounts to a repetition of the previous bridi, or part of it.
...

Example 5.89. 

la	.djan.	klama	le	zarci
That-named	John	goes-to	the	market.
you may retort:

Example 5.90. 

la	.djan.	go'i	troci
That-named	John	[repeat-last]	are-a-trier.
John tries to.

Example 5.90 is short for:

Example 5.91. 

la	.djan.	klama	be	le	zarci	be'o		troci
That-named	John	is-a-goer	(	to-the	market	)	type-of	trier.
because the whole bridi of Example 5.89 has been packaged up into the single word go'i and inserted into Example 5.90.

```

We can see that **go'i** copies the whole **la	.djan.	klama	le	zarci**.

== 7.6 ==

```

6.10)  A: mi ba klama le zarci
       B: mi nelci le si'o mi go'i
       A: do go'e

       A: I [future] go-to the store.
       B: I like the concept-of I [repeat last bridi].
       A: You [repeat last bridi but one].

       A: I am going to the store.
       B: I like the idea of my going.
       A: You’ll go, too.
Here B’s sentence repeats A’s within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): “le si'o mi go'i” means “le si'o mi klama le zarci”. Why must B use the word “mi” explicitly to replace the x1 of “mi klama le zarci”, even though it looks like “mi” is replacing “mi”? Because B’s “mi” refers to B, whereas A’s “mi” refers to A. If B said:
6.11)  mi nelci le si'o go'i
that would mean:
     I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by “go'i” is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to “do”, meaning B. Note that in Example 6.10, the tense “ba” (future time) is carried along by both “go'i” and “go'e”.
```

I consider a minor bug here: `“le si'o mi go'i” means “le si'o mi klama le zarci”` should be changed to `“le si'o mi go'i” means “le si'o mi ba klama le zarci”`.

One application of negation is in answer to truth questions (those which expect the answers “Yes” or “No”). The truth question cmavo xu is in selma'o UI; placed at the beginning of a sentence, it asks whether the sentence as a whole is true or false.

Example 15.80. 

xu	la	.djan.	pu	klama
Is-it-true-that:	(that-named	John	previously	went-to
la	.paris.	.e	la	.rom.
that-named	Paris	and	that-named	Rome.)
You can now use each of the several kinds of negation we've discussed in answer to this (presuming the same question and context for each answer).

The straightforward negative answer is grammatically equivalent to the expanded sentence with the na immediately after the cu (and before any tense/modal):

Example 15.81. 

na	go'i
[false]	[repeat-previous]
No.

which means

Example 15.82. 

la	.djan.	[cu]	na	pu	klama
That-named	John	[false]	previously	went-to
la	.paris.	.e	la	.rom.
that-named	Paris	and	that-named	Rome.
It's not true that John went to Paris and Rome.

The respondent can change the tense, putting the na in either before or after the new tense:

Example 15.83. 

na	ba	go'i
[false]	[future]	[repeat-previous]
meaning

Example 15.84. 

la	.djan.	[cu]	na	ba	klama
That-named	John		[false]	later	will-go-to
la	.paris.	.e	la	.rom.
that-named	Paris	and	that-named	Rome.
It is false that John will go to Paris and Rome.

or alternatively

Example 15.85. 

ba	na	go'i
[future]	[false]	[repeat-previous]
meaning

Example 15.86. 

la	.djan.	[cu]	ba	na
that-named	John		later-will	[false]
klama	la	.paris.	.e	la	.rom.
go-to	that-named	Paris	and	that-named	Rome.

We stated in Section 15.3 that sentences like Example 15.84 and Example 15.86 appear to be semantically identical, but that subtle semantic distinctions may eventually be found.
