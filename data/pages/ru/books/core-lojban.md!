<div class="lojbo">

Large parts of English can be described as expressing relations. In that regard English (despite being often ambiguous and having complex grammar) can still be used to relay the basics of Lojban. At first let's try to describe a portion of the English language using Lojban terms:

"I love you" is a bridi.
"love" is its selbri
"I" and "you" make up its terbri.

In layment terms:
* bridi is the relationship
* selbri is the relation
* terbri is a sequence of arguments in the relationship

<!-- Rephrasing in math terms:
* bridi is the expression with a function like `f(1,2)`
* selbri is the function `f(x,y)`
* terbri is the sequence of arguments `1,2`
The return value of the function can be thought of as always returning `true`. Consider a function `it is true that x is less than y`. -->

Rephrasing in linguistic terms:
* bridi is a clause
* selbri is the content verb, predicate
* terbri is a sequence of arguments, roles in the clause
