## Lesson 1. The language at a glance

### Alphabet

The basic thing you need to know about Lojban is the alphabet.

Lojban uses the Latin alphabet (vowels are colored):

<dl><dd><b><font color="#FF1493">a</font> b c d <font color="#FF1493">e</font> f g <font color="#FF1493">i</font> j k l m n <font color="#FF1493">o</font> p r s t <font color="#FF1493">u</font> v x <font color="#FF1493">y</font> z ' .</b></dd></dl>

Letters are pronounced as they are written.

There are 10 vowels in Lojban:

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font color="#FF1493" class="guibutton">a</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>f<u>a</u>ther</i> (not as in <i>face</i>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton"color="#FF1493">e</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>g<u>e</u>t</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton" color="#FF1493">i</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>mach<u>i</u>ne</i> (not as in <i>hit</i>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton" color="#FF1493">o</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>ch<u>o</u>ice</i>, <i>n<u>o</u>t</i> or <i>ough</i> in <i>th<u>ough</u>t</i> (not as in <i>so</i>, <b>o</b> should be a "pure" sound).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton" color="#FF1493">u</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>c<u>oo</u>l</i> (not as in <i>but</i>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton" color="#FF1493">y</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>comm<u>a</u></i> (not as in <i>misty</i> or <i>cycle</i>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tbody></table>

4 vowels are written using combinations of letters:

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font color="#FF1493" class="guibutton">au</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>c<u>ow</u></i></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font color="#FF1493" class="guibutton">ai</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>h<u>igh</u></i></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton"color="#FF1493">ei</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>w<u>eigh</u></i></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b class="audio-inline"><font class="guibutton" color="#FF1493">oi</font></b></td>
<td> as in <i>b<u>oy</u></i></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

As for consonants, they are pronounced like in English or Latin, but there are several differences:

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b class="guibutton">c</b></span>
</td>
<td>is pronounced as <i>c</i> in <i>ocean</i>, as <i>sh</i> in <i>shop</i>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b class="guibutton">g</b></span>
</td>
<td>always <i>g</i> as in <i>gum</i> (never <i>g</i> as in <i>gem</i>).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b class="guibutton">j</b></span>
</td>
<td>like <i>s</i> in <i>pleasure</i> or <i>treasure</i>, like <i>j</i> in French <i>bonjour</i>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b class="guibutton">x</b></span>
</td>
<td>like <i>ch</i> in Scottish <i>loch</i> or as in German <i>Bach</i>, like <i>J</i> in Spanish <i>Jose</i> or <i>Kh</i> in Modern Arabic <i>Khaled</i>. Try pronouncing <i>ksss</i> while keeping your tongue down and you get this sound.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b class="guibutton"> ' </b></span>
</td>
<td>like English <i>h</i>. So the apostrophe is regarded as a proper letter of Lojban and pronounced like a <i>h</i>. It can be found only between vowels. For example, <b>u'i</b> is pronounced as <i>oo-hee</i> (whereas <b>ui</b> is pronounced as <i>wee</i>).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b>.</b></span>
</td>
<td>a full stop (period, word break) is also regarded as a letter in Lojban. It's a short pause in speech to stop words running into each other. Actually any word starting with a vowel has a full stop placed in front of it. This helps prevent undesirable merging of two sequential words into one.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b>i</b></span>
</td>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b>i</b></span> before vowels is considered a consonant and pronounced shorter, for example:
<ul><li><b>ia</b> is pronounced as <i>ya</i> in <i>yard</i></li>
<li><b>ie</b> is pronounced as <i>ye</i> in <i>yes</i></li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b>u</b></span>
</td>
<td><span class="audio-inline"><b>u</b></span> before vowels is considered a consonant and pronounced shorter, for example:
<ul><li><b>ua</b> is pronounced as <i>wo</i> in <i>wow</i></li>
<li><b>ue</b> is pronounced as <i>whe</i> in <i>when</i></li></ul>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Stress is placed on the second to last vowel. If a word has only one vowel, you just don't stress it.

The letter **r** can be pronounced like the the _r_ in English, Scottish, Russian, so there is a range of acceptable pronunciation for it.

Non-Lojban vowels like the short _i_ and _u_ in Standard British English _hit_ and _but_, are used by some people to separate consonants. So, if you have trouble pronouncing two consonants in a row (e.g. the **vl** in **tavla**, which means _to talk to_), then you can say _tav…™la_ ‚Äî where the _…™_ is very short. However, other vowels like **a** and **u** must be long.

### The simplest sentence

Now, let's construct our first sentences in Lojban.

The basic unit in Lojban is called **bridi**, meaning "sentence". Here are three simple examples:

> **le prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The person speaks to me._

le prenu
: the person

tavla
: ‚Ä¶ talks to ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ speaks to ‚Ä¶

mi
: I, me

> **mi prami do**
> _I love you._

prami
: ‚Ä¶ loves ‚Ä¶ (someone)

do
: you

> **mi ca cu tavla do**
> _I now talk to you._

ca
: now

Each sentence in Lojban consists of the following parts from the left to the right:

- the head:
  - consists of so-called "terms",
  - **le prenu** is the only head term in the example **le prenu cu tavla mi** above,
  - **mi**, **ca** are head terms in the example **mi ca cu tavla do** above.
- the head separator **cu**:
  - pronounced as _shoe_ since **c** is for _sh_,
  - shows that the head has ended,
  - can be omitted when it's clear that the head is completed.
- the tail:
  - the main relation construct (**tavla**, **prami**) with possibly one or more terms after it,
  - **mi** is the only tail term in the example **le prenu cu tavla mi** above.
  - **do** is the only tail term in the example **mi ca cu tavla do** above.

In Lojban, we mostly speak of relations rather than nouns and verbs.

Here are the two relation words, which roughly correspond to verbs:

prenu
: ‚Ä¶ is a person / are people

tavla
: ‚Ä¶ speaks to ‚Ä¶

To turn such "verb" into a noun we put a short word **le** in front of it:

le prenu
: the person

Similarly,

tavla
: ‚Ä¶ speaks to ‚Ä¶

and thus

le tavla
: the speaker

It might sound strange how _person_ can be a "verb", but in fact, this makes Lojban very simple:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>relation word</th>
<th>noun</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>prenu</b> ‚Äî <i>to be a person</i> </td>
<td><b>le prenu</b> ‚Äî <i>the person</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>tavla</b> ‚Äî <i>to speak to</i> </td>
<td><b>le tavla</b> ‚Äî <i>the speaker</i>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

We can also say that **le** creates a noun from a relation construct with roughly the meaning of _the one which is ‚Ä¶_ (_is a person_ ‚Äî _the person_), or even _those who do‚Ä¶_ (_to speak to_ ‚Äî _the speakers_), _those who are‚Ä¶_ (_are people_ ‚Äî _the people_).

Notice, that Lojban, by default, doesn't differentiate between _the speaker_ or _the speakers_. That is, **le tavla** is vague in that regard, and we will soon discover ways to define the number.

Terms in Lojban, no matter where they are used in a given sentence, are mostly represented with:

- nouns like **le prenu** (_the person_)
- pronouns like **mi** (_I_, _me_), **do** (_you_). Pronouns work exactly as nouns, but **le** is not used for them. They work as nouns on their own.
- modal terms like **ca** (_now, in present_). Modal terms specify additional, —Ålarifying information.

Some more examples:

> **mi nintadni**
> _I am a new student._

nintadni
: ‚Ä¶ is a new student, a newbie

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/nintadni.svg" caption="mi nintadni" definition="I am a new student, a fresher."></pixra>

Unlike in English we don't have to add the verb "am/is/are/to be" to the sentence. It is already there. The relation word **nintadni** (_‚Ä¶ is a new student_) already has this English "am/is/are/to be" built into its English translation.

> **do jimpe**
> _You understand._

<!-- -->

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/pilno_le_fonxa.svg" caption="le prenu cu pilno le fonxa" definition="The person uses the phone."></pixra>

> **mi pilno le fonxa**
> _I use the phone._


pilno
: ‚Ä¶ uses ‚Ä¶ (something)

fonxa
: ‚Ä¶ is a phone, ‚Ä¶ are phones

le fonxa
: the phone, the phones


> **mi citka**
> _I eat._

citka
: ‚Ä¶ eats ‚Ä¶ (something)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/citka.svg" caption="mi citka" definition="I eat."></pixra>
<!-- -->

> **do citka**
> _You eat._

<!-- -->

> **mi citka le plise**
> _I eat the apples._

<!-- -->

> **le plise cu kukte**
> _The apples are tasty._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_plise_cu_kukte.svg" caption="le plise cu kukte" definition="The apples are tasty."></pixra>

Here, **le plise** means _the apples_, **kukte** means _is tasty / are tasty_.

A simpler sentence in Lojban would contain only one main relation word:

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/karce.svg" caption="karce" definition="It is a car."></pixra>

> **karce**
> _Car!_
> _It is a car._

You could say this when you see a car coming. Here the context would be clear enough that there is a car somewhere around and probably it's dangerous.

**karce** itself is a verb meaning _is a car, to be a car_.

We can of course be more precise and say, for example:


> **ti karce**
> _This is a car._

ti
: pronoun: this thing near me

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/ti.svg" caption="ti" definition="this one (near me, the speaker)"></pixra>

Similarly, you can say

> **carvi**
> _It is raining._

where

carvi
: ‚Ä¶ is a rain, ‚Ä¶ is raining

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/carvi.svg" caption="carvi" definition="‚Ä¶ is a rain"></pixra>

or

> **pluka**
> _It's pleasant_

where

pluka
: ‚Ä¶ is pleasant

Notice that in Lojban there is no need in the word _it_ in such sense. You just use the relation word you need.

> **prami**
> _Someone loves._

<!-- -->

> **bajra**
> _Someone runs._

bajra
: ‚Ä¶ runs using limbs

Again context would probably tell who loves whom and who runs.

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/bajra.svg" caption="le prenu cu bajra" definition="The person runs."></pixra>

#### Task

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/pinxe_le_djacu.svg" caption="le prenu cu pinxe le djacu" definition="The person drinks the water."></pixra>

pinxe
: ‚Ä¶ drinks ‚Ä¶ (something)

le djacu
: the water

<table style="table-layout: fixed;">
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>do citka</b>
</td>
<td><i>You eat.</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>mi pinxe le djacu</b>
</td>
<td><i>I drink water.</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>mi citka le plise</b>
</td>
<td><i>I eat apples.</i>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

### ¬´**.i**¬ª separates sentences

The most precise way of uttering or writing sentences in Lojban would be placing a short word **.i** in the beginning of each of them:

> **mi tavla le prenu .i le prenu cu tavla mi**
> _I'm talking to the people. The people are talking to me._

**.i** separates sentences like the full stop (period) at the end of sentences in English texts.

When saying one sentence after another in English we make a pause (it may be short) between them. But pause has many different meanings in English. In Lojban we have a better way of understanding where one sentence ends and another begins.

Also note that sometimes when pronouncing words quickly you can't figure out where one sentence ends and the word of the next sentence begins. Therefore it's advised to use the word **.i** before starting a new sentence.

### Numbers: ‚Äò_1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0_‚Äô = ¬´**pa re ci vo mu xa ze bi so no**¬ª

**le** simply turns a verb into a noun, but such noun has no number associated with it. The sentence

> **le prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The people talk to me._
> _The person talks to me._

doesn't specify the number of people talking to me. In English, it is impossible to omit the number because _people_ in English implies _more than one person_. However, in Lojban, you can omit the number even if it is plural.

Now let's specify how many of the people are relevant to our discussion.

Let's add a number after **le**.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>pa</b>
</td>
<td><b>re</b>
</td>
<td><b>ci</b>
</td>
<td><b>vo</b>
</td>
<td><b>mu</b>
</td>
<td><b>xa</b>
</td>
<td><b>ze</b>
</td>
<td><b>bi</b>
</td>
<td><b>so</b>
</td>
<td><b>no</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> 2
</td>
<td> 3
</td>
<td> 4
</td>
<td> 5
</td>
<td> 6
</td>
<td> 7
</td>
<td> 8
</td>
<td> 9
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/ci_prenu.svg" caption="le ci prenu" definition="The three people"></pixra>

> **le pa prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The person talks to me._
> _The one person talks to me._

We add a number after **le** and thus specify individual people.

For numbers consisting of several digits, we just string those digits together.

> **le re mu prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The 25 people talk to me._

Yes, it's that simple.

If we want to count, we can separate numbers with **.i**:

> **mu .i vo .i ci .i re .i pa .i no**
> _5 ‚Ä¶ 4 ‚Ä¶ 3 ‚Ä¶ 2 ‚Ä¶ 1 ‚Ä¶ 0_

The number **za'u** means _more than ‚Ä¶_ (_\>_ in math), the number **me'i** means _less than_ (_<_ in math):

> **le za'u re prenu cu tavla mi**
> _More than two people talk to me._

<!-- -->

> **le me'i pa no prenu cu tavla mi**
> _Fewer than 10 people talk to me._

<!-- -->

> **le za'u ci prenu cu tavla mi**
> _More than three people talk to me._

To say just _people_ (plural number) as opposed to _one person_, we use **za'u pa**, _more than one_ or simply **za'u**.

> **le za'u pa prenu cu tavla mi**
> **le za'u prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The people talk to me._

**za'u** by default means **za'u pa**, hence such contraction is possible.

le prenu
: the person / the people (in general)

le pa prenu
: the person (one in number)

le za'u prenu
: the people (two or more in number)

### Compound verbs

Compound verbs (**le tanru** in Lojban) are several verb words placed one after another.


> **tu melbi zdani**
> _That one is a nice home._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/melbi_zdani.svg" caption="melbi zdani" definition="‚Ä¶ is a nice home"></pixra>

tu
: that one (away from you and me)

melbi
: ‚Ä¶ is beautiful, nice

zdani
: ‚Ä¶ is a home or nest to ‚Ä¶ (someone)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/dansu.svg" caption="le prenu cu melbi dansu" definition="The person nicely dances."></pixra>

> **do melbi dansu**
> _You nicely dance._

dansu
: ‚Ä¶ dances

Here, the verb **melbi** adds an additional meaning as it is to the left of another verb: **zdani**. The left part is usually translated using adjectives and adverbs.

Compound verbs are a powerful tool that can give us richer verbs. You just string two verbs together, and the left part of such compound verb adds a flavor to the right one.

We can put **le** (e.g. with a number) to the left of such compound verb getting a compound noun:

le pa melbi zdani
: the beautiful home

Now you know why there was **cu** after nouns in our example:

> **le pa prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The person talks to me._

Without **cu** it'd turn into **le pa prenu tavla**, which would have the meaning of _the person-talker_ - whatever that could mean.

Consider:

> **le pa tavla pendo**
> _The talking friend_
<!-- -->
> **le pa tavla cu pendo**
> _The talking one is a friend._

Remember about placing **cu** before the main relation construct in a sentence to prevent unintentional creation of compound verbs.

Compound verbs can contain more than two verbs. In this case, the first verb modifies the second one, the second one modifies the third, and so on:

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/cmalu_karce.svg" caption="ti cmalu karce" definition="This is a small car."></pixra>

> **le pa melbi cmalu karce**
> _the pretty-small car, the car small in a pretty way_

<!-- -->

> **le mutce melbi zdani**
> _the very beautiful home_

mutce
: ‚Ä¶ is very, ‚Ä¶ is much

#### Task

### ‚Äò_Yes/No_‚Äô questions

In English, we form a _yes/no_ question by changing the order of the words, for example

> _You are ‚Ä¶ ‚áí Are you ‚Ä¶?_

or by using some form of the verb _to do_ at the beginning, for example:

> _You know ‚Ä¶ ‚áí Do you know?_

In Lojban, the word order can be retained. To turn any assertion into a _yes/no_ question, we simply insert the word **xu** somewhere in the sentence, for example, at the beginning:

> **xu do nelci le gerku**
> _Do you like the dogs?_


le gerku
: the dog, the dogs

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_prenu_e_le_gerku.svg" caption="ti prenu .i ti gerku" definition="This is a person. This is a dog."></pixra>

Remember that in Lojban, punctuation like "?" (question mark) is mostly optional and used mostly for stylistic purposes. This is because the question word **xu** already shows that it is a question.

Other examples:

> **xu mi klama**
> _Am I coming?_

klama
: ‚Ä¶ comes to ‚Ä¶ (somewhere)

> **xu pelxu**
> _Is it yellow?_

pelxu
: ‚Ä¶ is yellow

We can shift the meaning by placing **xu** after different parts of the relation. Explanations what changed in the meaning are given in brackets:

> **xu do nelci le gerku**
> _Do you like the dogs?_

<!-- -->

> **do xu nelci le gerku**
> _Do YOU like the dogs?_ (I thought it was someone else who likes them).

<!-- -->

> **do nelci xu le gerku**
> _Do you LIKE the dogs? (I thought you were just neutral towards them)._

<!-- -->

> **do nelci le gerku xu**
> _Do you like the DOGS? (I thought you liked cats)._

What is expressed using intonation in English is expressed by moving **xu** after the part we want to emphasize in Lojban. Note that the first sentence with **xu** in the beginning asks the most generic question without stressing any particular aspect.

**xu** is an interjection word. Here are the features of Lojban interjections:

- interjection modifies the construct before it. So, when placed after certain parts of the relation, like pronouns or verbs, it modifies that verb:

 > **do xu nelci le gerku**
 > _Do YOU like the dogs?_

- when placed at the beginning of a relation, interjection modifies the whole relation:

 > **xu do nelci le gerku**
 > _Do you like the dogs?_

- interjections can be placed after different parts of the same relation to shift the meaning.

Interjections don't break compound verbs, they can be used within them:

> **do nelci le barda xu gerku**
> _Do you like the BIG dogs?_

Now, how to reply to such 'yes/no' questions? You repeat the main relation:

> **‚Äî xu le mlatu cu melbi**
> **‚Äî melbi**
> _‚Äî Are the cats pretty?_
> _‚Äî Pretty._

To answer 'no', we use the modal term **na ku**:

> **‚Äî xu le mlatu cu melbi**
> **‚Äî na ku melbi**
> _‚Äî Are the cats pretty?_
> _‚Äî Not pretty._

na ku
: term: it is false that ‚Ä¶

Or, we can use a special verb **go'i**:

> **‚Äî xu le mlatu cu melbi**
> **‚Äî go'i**
> _‚Äî Are the cats pretty?_
> _‚Äî Pretty._

go'i
: verb that repeats the main relation of the previous sentence

Here, **go'i** means the same as **melbi** since **melbi** is the relation of the previous relation.

> **‚Äî xu le mlatu cu melbi**
> **‚Äî na ku go'i**
> _‚Äî Are the cats pretty?_
> _‚Äî Not pretty._

<!-- This course doesn't recommend negating **go'i** for negative answers. Just use **je'u nai**. -->

The modal term **na ku** can be used not only in answers:

> **na ku mi nelci le gerku**
> _It is false that I like the dogs._
> _I don't like the dogs._
<!-- -->
> **mi na ku nelci do**
> _I don't like you._

Its opposite, the term **ja'a ku** affirms the meaning:

> **mi ja'a ku nelci do**
> _I do like you._

ja'a ku
: term: it is true that ‚Ä¶

### Polite requests

The interjection **.e'o** at the beginning of a sentence turns it into a polite request:

> **.e'o do lebna le fonxa**
> _Could you take the phone, please?_
> `Please take the phone.`

.e'o
: interjection: please (pronounced as _eh-haw_ with a short pause or break before the word)

lebna
: to take (something)

In English, to be polite, one has to use _could you_ + _please_ + a question). In Lojban, **.e'o** is enough to make a polite request.

### ‚Äò_And_‚Äô and ‚Äò_or_‚Äô

> **do nintadni .i je mi nintadni**
> _You are a newbie. And I am a newbie._

<!-- -->

> **do .e mi nintadni**
> _You and I are newbies._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/do_e_mi_nintadni.svg" caption="do .e mi nintadni" definition="You and I are new students."></pixra>

<!-- -->

> **mi tadni .i je mi tavla do**
> _I study. And I talk to you._

<!-- -->

> **mi tadni gi'e tavla do**
> _I study and talk to you._

.i je
: conjunction "and" combining sentences into one.

.e
: conjunction "and" connecting nouns.

gi'e
: conjunction "and" connecting sentence tails.

We can combine two sentences into one statement using the conjunction **.i je**, which means _and_:

> **do nintadni .i je mi nintadni**
> _You are a newbie. And I am a newbie._

Since both sentences have the same tail, we can use a contraction: the conjunction **.e** means _and_ for nouns and pronouns:

> **do .e mi nintadni**
> _You and I are newbies._

**do nintadni .i je mi nintadni** means exactly the same as **do .e mi nintadni**

We can also use **.e** for connecting nouns and pronouns in other positions.

Both of these sentences mean the same thing.


> **mi pinxe le djacu .e le jisra**
> _I drink the water and the juice._
> **mi pinxe le djacu .i je mi pinxe le jisra**
> _I drink the water, and I drink the juice._

le jisra
: juice

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/pinxe_le_jisra.svg" caption="le prenu cu pinxe le jisra" definition="The person drinks the juice."></pixra>

If the sentence head is the same but the tails differ, we use the conjunction **gi'e**, which means _and_ for sentence tails:

> **mi tadni .i je mi tavla do**
> **mi tadni gi'e tavla do**
> _I study and talk to you._

Both variations mean the same; **gi'e** simply leads to a more consise realization.

We also have tools to add _and_ for components of compound verbs:

> **le melbi je cmalu zdani cu jibni ti**
> _The pretty and small home is near._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/melbi_je_cmalu_zdani.svg" caption="melbi je cmalu zdani" definition="‚Ä¶ is a pretty-and-small home"></pixra>

jibni
: ‚Ä¶ is near to ‚Ä¶

ti
: this thing, this place near me

**je** is a conjunction in Lojban that means _and_ in compound verbs.

Without **je**, the sentence changes the meaning:

> **le melbi cmalu zdani cu jibni**
> _The prettily small home is near._

Here **melbi** modifies **cmalu**, and **melbi cmalu** modifies **zdani**, according to how compound verbs work.

In **le melbi je cmalu zdani** (_the pretty and small house_) both **melbi** and **cmalu** modify **zdani** directly.

Other common conjunctions include:

> **le verba cu fengu ja bilma**
> _The child is angry or ill (or maybe both angry and ill)_

<!-- -->

> **do .a mi ba vitke le dzena**
> _You or I (or both of us) will visit the ancestor._

ja
: and/or

**.a** = _and/or_ when connecting nouns and pronouns.


fengu
: ‚Ä¶ is angry

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/fengu.svg" caption="fengu" definition="‚Ä¶ is angry"></pixra>

bilma
: ‚Ä¶ is ill

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/bilma.svg" caption="le prenu cu bilma" definition="The person is ill"></pixra>

vitke
: to visit

dzena
: ‚Ä¶ is an ancestor of ‚Ä¶

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/dzena.svg" caption="dzena" definition="‚Ä¶ is an ancestor of ‚Ä¶"></pixra>

> **le karce cu blabi jo nai grusi**
> _The car is either white or gray._

<!-- -->

> **do .o nai mi vitke le laldo**
> _Either you or I visit the old one._

jo nai
: either ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶ but not both

.o nai
: either ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶ but not both (when connecting nouns and pronouns)

laldo
: ‚Ä¶ is old

Note: it's better to remember **jo nai** as a single construct, and the same for **.o nai**.

> **mi prami do .i ju do stati**
> _I love you. Whether or not you are smart._

<!-- -->

> **le verba cu nelci le plise .u le badna**
> _The child likes the apples whether or not (he/she likes) the bananas._

ju
: whether or not ‚Ä¶

.u
: whether or not ‚Ä¶ (when connecting nouns and pronouns)

### ¬´**joi**¬ª is ‚Äò_and_‚Äô for mass actions

> **do joi mi casnu le bangu**
> _You and I are discussing the language._

casnu
: ‚Ä¶ discusses ‚Ä¶

le bangu
: the language

joi
: conjunction _and_ for masses

If I say **do .e mi casnu le bangu** it may mean that you discuss the language, and I discuss the language. But it doesn't necessarily mean that we are in the same conversation!

This can be made more visible if we expand this using **.i je**:

> **do .e mi casnu le bangu**
> **do casnu le bangu .i je mi casnu le bangu**
> _You discuss the language. And I discuss the language._

In order to emphasize that you and I participate in the same action, we use a special conjunction **joi** meaning _and_ that forms a "mass":

> **do joi mi casnu le bangu**
> _You and I are discussing the language._
> _You and I being a single entity for this event are discussing the language._

The pronoun **mi'o** (_you and I together_) can actually be expressed as **mi joi do**, which means exactly the same (it's just longer). In Lojban, you may use not a single word for _we_ but more precise constructs like **mi joi le pendo** (literally _I and the friends_).

### But ‚Ä¶

> **le najnimre cu barda .i je ku'i le badna cu cmalu**
> _The oranges are big. But the bananas are small._

ku'i
: interjection: but, however

Actually, in English, _but_ is the same as _and_, and it adds a flavor of contrast.

In Lojban, we just use the conjunction **.i je** (or **.e**, **gi'e**, **je**, depending on what we connect) and add the flavor of contrast to it with the interjection **ku'i**. That will give us the necessary contrast. As usual, the interjection modifies the construct before it.

### Events: ‚Äò_dancing and being together_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**le nu dansu .e le nu kansa**¬ª

Any relation can be turned into a verb by putting **nu** in front of it:

> **le nicte cu nu mi viska le lunra**
> _The night is when I see the Moon._
> `Night is an event when I see the Moon.`


nicte
: (some event) is nighttime

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/nicte_fi_mi.svg" caption="le nicte" definition="the nighttime"></pixra>

le nicte
: the nighttime, nighttimes

viska
: to see (something)

le lunra
: the Moon

Here, **le nicte** is a noun in the sentence and **nu mi viska le lunra** is the main relation of the sentence.  However, within this main relation, we can see another relation: **mi viska le lunra** embedded!

The word **nu** transforms a sentence into a verb that denotes an event or a process.

By adding **le** in front of **nu**, we create a noun that denotes an event:

pinxe ‚áí le nu pinxe
: to drink ‚áí the drinking

dansu ‚áí le nu dansu
: to dance ‚áí the dancing

kansa ‚áí le nu kansa
: ‚Ä¶ is together with ‚Ä¶ ‚áí being together

klama ‚áí le nu klama
: to come to ‚Ä¶ ‚áí the coming

le nu do klama
: the coming of you, you coming

**le nu** often corresponds to English _\-ing_, _\-tion_, _\-sion_.

Some verbs require using events instead of ordinary nouns. For example:

> **mi djica le nu do klama ti**
> _I want you to come here (to this place)_

djica
: to want (some event)

> **mi gleki le nu do klama**
> _I'm happy because you are coming._

gleki
: ‚Ä¶ is happy (of some event)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/gleki.svg" caption="gleki" definition="‚Ä¶ is happy about event ‚Ä¶"></pixra>

Some nouns describe events by themselves so no **le nu** is used:

> **le cabna cu nicte**
> _Now it's night. At present it's night._

le cabna
: the present time, the present event.

Nouns made with **le nu** can be used for verbs that describe events by themselves:

> **le nu pinxe le jisra cu nabmi mi**
> _Drinking the juice is a problem to me._

nabmi
: (event) is a problem (to someone), (event) is problematic (to someone)

All Lojban words are divided into two groups:

- particles (called **le cmavo** in Lojban). Examples: **le**, **nu**, **mi**
- verbs (called **le selbrivla** in Lojban). Examples: **gleki**, **klama**.
  It is quite common to write several particles one after another without spaces between them. This is allowed by Lojban grammar. So don't be surprised to see **lenu** instead of **le nu**, **naku** instead of **na ku**, **jonai** instead of **jo nai** and so on. This doesn't change the meaning. However, this is not applied to verbs: they are to be separated with spaces.

### Modal terms. Simple tenses: ‚Äò_was_‚Äô, ‚Äò_is_‚Äô, ‚Äò_will be_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**pu**¬ª, ¬´**ca**¬ª, ¬´**ba**¬ª

In Lojban, we express the time when something happens (grammatically, in English it's usually called _tense_) with modal terms. We've already seen the modal term **ca** meaning _at present_.

Here is a series of time-related terms that tell when something happens:

> **le prenu pu cu tavla mi**
> _The people talked to me._

<!-- -->

> **le prenu ca cu tavla mi**
> _The people talk to me (at present)._

<!-- -->

> **le prenu ba cu tavla mi**
> _The people will talk to me._

When after the time-related particle we place a bare noun then we form a term with a slightly different meaning:

> **mi pinxe le djacu ca le nu do klama**
> _I drink the water while you are coming._

The **ca le nu do klama** part is a long term meaning _while you come / while you are coming_. The **le nu do klama** is a noun meaning **coming of you, you coming**.

> **mi citka ba le nu mi dansu**
> _I eat after I dance._

Time-related particles are grouped into series by their meaning to make them easier to remember and use.

Words for simple tense:

- **pu** means _before ‚Ä¶ (some event)_, **pu** alone denotes past tense.
- **ca** means _at the same time as ‚Ä¶ (some event)_, **ca** alone denotes present tense.
- **ba** means _after ‚Ä¶ (some event)_, **ba** alone denotes future tense.

Tenses add information about time when something happens. English forces us to use certain tenses. One has to choose between

- _The people talk to me_.
- _The people talked to me_.
- _The people will talk to me_.

and other similar choices.

But in Lojban tense particles are optional, we can be as vague or as precise as we want.

The sentence

> **le prenu cu tavla mi**
> _The people talk to me._

actually says nothing about when this happens. Context is clear enough in most cases and can help us. But if we need more precision we just add more words.

Similarly, **ba** means _after ‚Ä¶ (some event)_ so when we say **mi ba cu citka** we mean that we eat after the moment of speaking, that's why it means _I will eat_.

We can combine tense particles with and without noun arguments after them:

> **mi pu cu citka le plise ba le nu mi dansu**
> _I ate the apples after I danced._

Note that the term **pu** (past tense) is put only in the main relation (**mi pu cu citka**). In Lojban, it is assumed that the event _I danced_ occurs relative to the event of eating.

We shouldn't put **pu** with **dansu** (unlike English) as **mi dansu** is viewed relative to **mi pu cu citka** so we already know that everything was in past.

More examples of time-related terms:

> **le nicte cu pluka**
> _The night is pleasant._

pluka
: ‚Ä¶ is pleasant

> **ba le nicte cu pluka**
> _After the night it is pleasant._

Here, the head of the sentence contains one term **ba le nicte**, a term with its noun. Then after the separator **cu**, the main relation of the sentence **pluka** is followed (**pluka** alone means _It is pleasant._)

To say _will be pleasant_ we should use the past tense term:

> **le nicte ba cu pluka**
> _The night will be pleasant._

Also note that adding a noun after a time-related particle can lead to a drastically different meaning:

> **le nicte ba le nu citka cu pluka**
> _The night is pleasant after eating._

Note that **ca** can extend slightly into the past and the future, meaning _just about now_. Thus, **ca** reflects a widely used around the world notion of "present time".

It's also possible to integrate modal particles into the main relation construct:

> **le nicte ba cu pluka**
> **le nicte ba pluka**
> _The night will be pleasant._

Both sentences mean the same, **ba pluka** is a relation construct meaning _‚Ä¶ will be pleasant_.

The structure of **le nicte ba pluka** is the following:

- **le nicte** ‚Äî the head of the sentence with just one term **le nicte**
- **ba pluka** ‚Äî the tail of the sentence with just one verb **ba pluka**

Contrast this with the previous sentence **le nicte ba cu pluka**:

- **le nicte ba** ‚Äî the head of the sentence with two terms **le nicte** and **ba**
- **pluka** ‚Äî the tail of the sentence with just one verb **pluka**

The advantage of **le nicte ba pluka** over **le nicte ba cu pluka** is only in conciseness; you can usually skip saying **cu** in such cases since the sentence can't be understood otherwise anyway.

If you wish to put a modal term before a noun you can separate it from the following text by explicitly "ending" the term with the helper word **ku**:

> **ba ku le nicte cu pluka**
> **le nicte ba cu pluka**
> **le nicte ba pluka**
> _The night will be pleasant._

**ku** prevents **ba le nicte** from appearing thus retaining **ba ku** and **le nicte** as separate terms.


One last note: English definitions of Lojban words may use tenses even when the original Lojban words do not imply them, e.g.:

tavla
: ‚Ä¶ talks to ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ speaks to ‚Ä¶

pluka
: ‚Ä¶ is pleasant

Although _talks_, _is_ etc. are in the present tense (we can't always get rid of tense in English words because that's how English works), we must always assume that tense is not implied in the meaning of the defined Lojban words unless the English definition of such words explicitly mentions such tense restrictions.

### Modal terms. Event contours: ¬´**co'a**¬ª, ¬´**ca'o**¬ª, ¬´**co'i**¬ª

Another series of time-related particles, _event contours_:

co'a
: tense particle: the event is at its beginning

ca'o
: tense particle: the event is in progress

mo'u
: tense particle: the event is complete

co'i
: tense particle: the event is viewed as a whole (has started and then finished)

Most verbs describe events without specifying the stage of those events. Event contours allow us to be more precise:

> **mi pu co'a —Åu cikna**
> **mi pu co'a cikna**
> _I woke up._

cikna
: ‚Ä¶ is awake

co'a cikna
: ‚Ä¶ wakes up, becomes awake

pu co'a cikna
: ‚Ä¶ woke up, became awake

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/coha_cikna.svg" caption="le prenu co'a cikna" definition="The person wakes up."></pixra>

To precisely express the English Progressive tense, we use **ca'o**:

> **mi pu ca'o —Åu sipna**
> **mi pu ca'o sipna**
> _I was sleeping._

sipna
: ‚Ä¶ sleeps

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sipna.svg" caption="le prenu ca'o sipna" definition="The person is sleeping."></pixra>

<!-- -->

> **mi ca ca'o pinxe**
> _I am drinking._

<!-- -->

> **mi ba ca'o pinxe**
> _I will be drinking._

**mo'u** is used for describing the completion of events:

> **mi mo'u klama le tcana**
> _I arrived at the station._

le tcana
: the station

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/mohu_klama_le_tcana.svg" caption="le prenu mo'u klama le tcana" definition="The person has arrived at the station."></pixra>

**co'i** usually corresponds to the English Perfect tense:

> **le verba ca co'i pinxe le jisra**
> _The children have drunk the juice._

We could omit **ca** in these sentence since the context would be clear enough in most such cases.

he English Present Simple tense describes events that happen sometimes:

> **le prenu ca ta'e tavla**
> _The people (habitually, sometimes) talk._

ta'e
: simple tense: the event happens habitually

We can use the same rules for describing the past using **pu** instead of **ca** or the future using **ba**:

> **le prenu pu co'i tavla mi**
> _The people had talked to me._

<!-- -->

> **le prenu ba co'i tavla mi**
> _The people will have talked to me._

The relative order of time-related particles is important. In **ca co'i** we first say something happens in present (**ca**), then we state that in this present time, the described event has been completed (**co'i**). Only when using this order do we get the Present Perfect tense.

### Modal terms. Intervals: ‚Äò_during_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**ze'a**¬ª

Another series of modal particles emphasizes that events happen during an interval:

ze'i
: for a short time

ze'a
: through some time, for a while, during ‚Ä¶

ze'u
: for a long time

> **mi pu ze'a cu sipna**
> **mi pu ze'a sipna**
> _I slept for a while._

<!-- -->

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sipna_zeha.svg" caption="le prenu cu sipna ze'a le nu carvi" definition="The person is sleeping while it's raining."></pixra>

> **mi pu ze'a le nicte cu sipna**
> _I slept through the night. I slept all night._

Note: we cannot elide **cu** here since **nicte sipna** (_‚Ä¶ is a night sleeper_) is a tanru and thus would lead to some other (if weird) meaning.

> **mi pu ze'i le nicte cu sipna**
> _I slept through the short night._

Compare **ze'a** with **ca**:

> **mi pu ca le nicte cu sipna**
> _I slept at night._

le nicte
: the nighttime

When using **ze'a**, we are talking about the whole interval of what we describe.

Note that **nicte** is itself an event, so we don't need **nu** here.

### Modal terms. ‚Äò_because_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**ri'a**¬ª, ‚Äò_towards_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**fa'a**¬ª, ‚Äò_at (place)_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**bu'u**¬ª

Modal particle for _because_:

> **mi pinxe ri'a le nu mi taske**
> _I drink because I am thirsty._

<!-- -->

> **mi citka ri'a le nu mi xagji**
> _I eat because I am hungry._

ri'a
: because ‚Ä¶ (of some event)


taske
: ‚Ä¶ is thirsty

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/taske.svg" caption="taske" definition="‚Ä¶ is thirsty"></pixra>

xagji
: ‚Ä¶ is hungry

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/xagji.svg" caption="xagji" definition="‚Ä¶ is hungry"></pixra>

Modal particles denoting place work in the same way:

> **mi cadzu fa'a do to'o le zdani**
> _I walk in the direction of you away from the home._

Note that, unlike **klama**, the modal particles **fa'a** and **to'o** denote directions, not necessarily start or end points of the route. For example:

> **le prenu cu klama fa'a do**
> _The person comes towards you._

means that the person is simply moving towards your direction, but not necessarily to you (maybe to some place or person near you).
 
<!-- -->

> **mi cadzu bu'u le tcadu**
> _I walk in the city._

fa'a
: towards ‚Ä¶, in the direction of ‚Ä¶

to'o
: from ‚Ä¶, from the direction of ‚Ä¶

bu'u
: at ‚Ä¶ (some place)

Note: **nu** shows that a new inner embedded sentence starts within the main sentence. We put **kei** after such relation to show its right border, similar to how we use ")" or "]" in math. For example:

> **le gerku cu plipe fa'a mi ca le nu do ca'o klama**
> _The dog jumps towards me when you are coming._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_gerku_faha_plipe.svg" caption="le gerku cu plipe fa'a mi" definition="The dog jumps towards me."></pixra>

plipe
: to jump

but

> **le gerku cu plipe ca le (nu do ca'o klama kei) fa'a mi**
> _The dog jumps (when you are coming) towards me._

Brackets _(_ and_)_ are used here only to show the structure; they are not necessary in a normal Lojban text.

We use **kei** after the inner sentence **do ca'o klama** to show that it ended, and the main relation continues with its **cu**, terms, nouns, pronouns.

Compare this sentence with the following:

> **le gerku cu plipe ca le (nu do ca'o klama fa'a mi)**
> _The dog jumps (when you are coming towards me)._

As you can see, **do klama fa'a mi** is a relation inside the bigger one, so **fa'a mi** is now inside it.

Now, it's not the dog that comes towards me, but you.

At the end of the statement, **kei** is never needed as it already signifies the right border.

Consider the following example with a time-related particle:

> **mi pu citka le plise ba le nu mi dansu**
> _I ate the apples after I danced._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu citka ba le nu mi dansu kei le plise**
> _I ate (after I danced) the apples._

We can rearrange the sentence by moving **ba le nu mi dansu** around, as long as it remains after **pu**.

### Names. Choosing a name

**le cmevla**, or _name word_, is a special kind of word used to build personal names. It's easy to recognize le cmevla in a text flow, as they are the only words that end in a consonant and are wrapped by one dot on each side.

Examples of le cmevla are: **.paris.**, **.robin.**

If one's name is _Bob_ then we can create a cmevla ourselves that would sound as close as possible to this name, for example: **.bab.**

The simplest example of using a name would be

> **la .bab. cu tcidu**
> _Bob reads/is reading._

tcidu
: ‚Ä¶ reads

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/tcidu_la_lojban.svg" caption="le prenu ca'o tcidu" definition="The person is reading."></pixra>

**la** is similar to **le**, but it converts a word into a name instead of a simple noun.

In English, we start a word with a capital letter to show that it is a name. In Lojban, we use the prefix word **la**.

Always use **la** when producing names!

A name can consist of several cmevla one after another:

> **la .bab.djansyn. cu tcidu**
> _Bob Johnson reads/is reading._

Here, we separated the two cmevla with just one dot, which is enough.

It's common to omit dots in front of and at the end of le cmevla to write texts faster, for example, when text chatting. After all, le cmevla are still separated from neighboring words by spaces around them:

> **la bab djansyn cu tcidu**

However, in spoken language, it is still necessary to put a short pause before and after le cmevla.

Bob's first name, the name of the language _Lojban_, can be used in Lojban without many changes:

> **la .lojban. cu bangu mi**
> _I speak Lojban._
> Lojban is a language of me.
> `Lojban is a language I use.`

bangu
: ‚Ä¶ is a language used by ‚Ä¶ (someone)

<!-- -->
> **mi nintadni la .lojban.**
> _I am a new student of Lojban._
<!-- -->
> **mi tadni la .lojban.**
> _I study Lojban._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/tadni.svg" caption="le prenu ca ca'o tadni la .lojban." definition="The person is now studying Lojban."></pixra>

Lojban letters directly correspond to sounds, so there are some rules for adapting names to how they are written in Lojban. This may sound strange ‚Äî after all, a name is a name ‚Äî but all languages do this to some extent. For example, English speakers tend to pronounce _Jose_ as _Hozay_, and _Margaret_ in Chinese is _Magelita_. Some sounds simply don't exist in some languages, so you need to rewrite the name so that it only contains Lojban sounds and is spelt according to letter-sound correspondence.

For example:

la .djansyn.
: Johnson (probably, closer to American pronunciation)

la .suzyn.
: Susan (the two letters _s_ are pronounced differently: the second one is actually a _z_, and the _a_ is not really an _a_ sound)

Pay attention to how the name is pronounced natively. As a result, the English and French names _Robert_ come out differently in Lojban: the English name is **.robyt.** in UK English, or **.rabyrt.** in some American dialects, but the French is **.rober.**

Here are "Lojbanizations" of some names:

- _Alice_ ‚áí **la .alis.**
- _Mei Li_ ‚áí **la .meilis.**
- _Bob_ ‚áí **la .bab.**
- _Abdul_ ‚áí **la .abdul.**
- _Yan or Ian_ ‚áí **la .ian.**
- _Ali_ ‚áí **la .al.**
- _Doris_ ‚áí **la .doris.**
- _Michelle_ ‚áí **la .micel.**
- _Kevin_ ‚áí **la .kevin.**
- _Edward_ ‚áí **la .edvard.**
- _Adam_ ‚áí **la .adam.**
- _Lucas_ ‚áí **la .lukas.**

Notes:

* Two additional full stops (periods) are necessary because if you don't put those pauses in speech, it might become difficult to know where the name starts and ends, or in other words, where the previous word ends and the next word begins.
* The last letter of a cmevla must be a consonant. If a name doesn't end in a consonant, we usually add an **s** to the end; so in Lojban, _Mary_ becomes **.meris.**, _Joe_ becomes **.djos.**, and so on. Alternatively, we can leave out the last vowel, so _Mary_ would become **.mer.** or **.meir**.
* You can also put a full stop between a person's first and last names (though it's not compulsory), so _Jim Jones_ becomes **.djim.djonz.**

### Rules for making le cmevla

Here is a compact representation of Lojban sounds:

- vowels:
  - **a e i o u y au ai ei oi**
- consonants:
  - **b d g v z j** (voiced)
  - **p t k f s c x** (unvoiced)
  - **l m n r**
  - **i u**. They are considered consonants when placed between two vowels or at the beginning of a word. **.iaua** ‚Äî **i** and **u** are consonants here. **.iai** ‚Äî here is the consonant **i** with the vowel **ai** after it.
  - **'** (apostrophe). It is placed only between two vowels: **.e'e**, **.u'i**
  - **.** (dot, word break)

To create a Lojban name, follow these rules:

1. the name must end in a consonant except **'**. If not, add a consonant at the end yourself. Additionally, wrap it with a dot from each side: **.lojban.**.
2. vowels can only be placed between two consonants:  **.sam.**, **.no'am.**
3. double consonants are merged into one: _dd_ becomes **d**, _nn_ becomes **n** etc. Or a **y** is placed between them: **.nyn.**
4. if a voiced and an unvoiced consonants are next to each other, insert a **y** between them: **kv** becomes **kyv**. Alternatively, you can remove one of the letters instead: **pb** can be turned into a single **p** or a single **b**.
5. if one of **c**, **j**, **s**, **z** are next to each other, insert a **y** between them: **jz** becomes **jyz**. Alternatively, you can remove one of the letters instead: **cs** can be turned into a single **c** or a single **s**.
6. if **x** is next to **c** or next to **k**, insert a **y** between them: **cx** becomes **cyx**, **xk** becomes **xyk**. Alternatively, you can remove one of the letters instead: **kx** can be turned into a single **x**.
7. the substrings **mz**, **nts**, **ntc**, **ndz**, **ndj** are fixed by adding a **y** inside or deleting one of the letters: **nytc** or **nc**, **.djeimyz.**
8. double **ii** between vowels is merged into a single **i**: **.eian.** (but not **.eiian.**)
9. double **uu** between vowels is merged into a single **u**: **.auan.** (but not **.auuan.**)
10. the sound for the English "h" as in Harry can be either dropped or replaced with **x**. _Harry_ can become **.aris.** or **.xaris.**

### Relation words as names

You can select an enjoyable nickname in Lojban by using not only cmevla but also relation words. You can also translate your present name into Lojban if you know what it means, or choose a completely new Lojban name.

Here are a few examples:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Original name </th>
<th> Original meaning </th>
<th> Word in Lojban </th>
<th> Meaning in Lojban </th>
<th> Your name
</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Alexis </td>
<td> <i>helper</i> in Greek </td>
<td><b>le sidju</b></td>
<td><i>the helper</i> </td>
<td><b>la sidju</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Ethan </td>
<td> <i>solid, during</i> in Hebrew </td>
<td><b>le sligu</b></td>
<td><i>the solid</i> </td>
<td><b>la sligu</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Mei Li </td>
<td><i>beautiful</i> in Mandarin Chinese </td>
<td><b>le melbi</b></td>
<td><i>the beautiful ones</i> </td>
<td><b>la melbi</b>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

### ‚Äò_he_‚Äô ‚Äò_she_‚Äô

Lojban doesn't have distinct words for _he_ or _she_. Possible solutions:

le ninmu
: the woman (in gender sense)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/ninmu.svg" caption="le ninmu" definition="the woman (female human)"></pixra>

le nanmu
: the male man (in gender sense)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/nanmu.svg" caption="le nanmu" definition="the man (male human)"></pixra>

> **le ninmu cu tavla le nanmu .i le ninmu cu jatna**
> _The woman talk to the man. She is a leader._

jatna
: ‚Ä¶ is a leader, commander

Lojbanists have proposed various words for other genders like

le nonmu
: the agender person

le nunmu
: the non-binary-gendered person

However, in most situations, using **le prenu** (_the person_) or personal names is sufficient.

Another choice is to use the short pronoun **ri**, which refers to the previous noun:

> **mi pu klama le nurma .i ri melbi**
> _I went to the country. It was beautiful._

le nurma
: the rural area

Here, **ri** refers to the country side.

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/nurma.svg" caption="nurma" definition="‚Ä¶ is a rural area"></pixra>

> **mi tavla le pendo .i ri jundi**
> _I talk to the friend. He/she is attentive._

jundi
: ‚Ä¶ is attentive

Here, **ri** refers to the friend.

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/jundi.svg" caption="le prenu cu jundi" definition="The person is attentive."></pixra>

Note: **ri** skips pronouns **mi** (_I_) and **do** (_you_):

> **le prenu cu tavla mi .i ri pendo mi**
> _The person talks to me. He/she is a friend of mine._

Here, **ri** skips the previous pronoun **mi** and thus refers to **le prenu** which is the preceding noun/pronoun available.

### Introducing yourself. Vocatives

In Lojban, _vocatives_ are words that behave like interjections (such as **xu** which we earlier discussed), but they require the following noun to be attached to them:

> **coi do**
> _Hello, you!_

coi
: vocative: Hello! Hi!

We use **coi** followed by a noun or pronoun to greet someone.

> **co'o do**
> _Goodbye to you._

co'o
: vocative: goodbye!

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/coho.svg" caption="co'o do" definition="Good-bye to you!"></pixra>

<div class="common"></div>

> **coi ro do**
> _Hello everyone!_
> `Hello each of you`

‚Äî is how people usually start a conversation with several people. Other numbers are possible of course: **coi re do** means *Hello you two* etc.

Since vocatives work like interjections we have nice types of greetings:

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/cerni.svg" caption="cerni" definition="‚Ä¶ is morning"></pixra>
<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/donri.svg" caption="donri" definition="‚Ä¶ is daylight time"></pixra>
<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/vanci.svg" caption="vanci" definition="‚Ä¶ is evening"></pixra>
<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/nicte.svg" caption="nicte" definition="‚Ä¶ is nighttime"></pixra>

<div class="common"></div>

> **cerni coi**
> _Good morning!_
> `It's morning ‚Äî Hello!`

<div class="common"></div>

> **vanci coi**
> _Good evening!_

<div class="common"></div>

> **donri coi**
> _Good day!_

<!-- -->

> **nicte coi**
> _Nightly greetings!_

Note: in English _Goodnight!_ means _Goodbye!_ or denotes wishing someone a good night. By its meaning, _Goodnight!_ doesn't belong to the series of greetings above. Thus, we use different wording in Lojban:

<div class="common"></div>

> **nicte co'o**
> _Good night!_

or

<div class="common"></div>

> **.a'o pluka nicte**
> _Pleasant night!_

.a'o
: interjection: I hope

pluka
: ‚Ä¶ is pleasant to ‚Ä¶ (someone)

Of course, we can be vague by just saying **pluka nicte** (just meaning _pleasant night_ without any wishes explicitly said).

The vocative **mi'e** + a noun/pronoun is used to introduce yourself:

> **mi'e la .doris.**
> _I'm Doris. This is Doris speaking._

mi'e
: vocative: identifies speaker

The vocative **doi** is used to address someone directly:

> **mi cliva doi la .robert.**
> _I'm leaving, Robert._

cliva
: to leave (something or someone)

Without **doi**, the name might become the first noun of the relation:

> **mi cliva la .robert.**
> _I'm leaving Robert._

**doi** is a like Old English _O_ (as in _O ye of little faith_) or the Latin vocative (as in _Et tu, Brute_). Some languages don't distinguish between these contexts, although as you can see, Old English and Latin did.

Two more vocatives are **ki'e** for saying thanks and **je'e** for accepting them:

> **‚Äî ki'e do do pu sidju mi**
> **‚Äî je'e do**
> _‚Äî Thank you, you helped me._
> _‚Äî Not at all._

sidju
: ‚Ä¶ helps ‚Ä¶ (someone)

We can omit the noun after the vocative only if this is at the end of the sentence. For example, we can just say:

> **‚Äî coi .i xu do kanro**
> _‚Äî Hello. How do you do?_
> `‚Äî Hello. Are you healthy?`

kanro
: ‚Ä¶ is healthy

Here, a new sentence starts immediately after the vocative **coi**, so we omitted the name. Or we can say:

> **coi do mi djica le nu do sidju mi**
> _Hello. I want you to help me._
> `Hello you. I want that you help me.`

Thus, if you don't know the name of the listener and you want to continue the same sentence after the vocative, you just place **do** after it.

If you use the vocative on its own (without a noun after it) and the sentence is not finished yet, then you need to separate it from the rest. This is because the things that are most likely to follow the vocative in a sentence could easily be misconstrued as describing your addressee. To separate it from the following noun/pronoun, use the word **do**. For example,

> **coi do la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**
> _Hello! Alice left Doris._
> `Hello you! Alice left Doris`

<!-- -->

> **coi la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**
> _Hello, Alice! Doris left._

And if you want to put both vocatives and interjections, modifying the whole sentence please put the interjections first:

> **.ui coi do la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**
> _Yay, Hello! Alice left Doris._

Note: in the beginning of a sentence, interjections are usually put before vocatives because:

> **coi .ui do la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva** means

> _Hello (I'm happy about this greeting) you! Alice left Doris._

So an interjection immediately after a vocative modifies that vocative. Similarly, an interjection modifies the vocative noun when being put after it:

> **coi do .ui la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**
> _Hello you (I'm happy about you)! Alice left Doris._

## Lesson 2. More basic stuff

### Order of arguments

Earlier we provided definitions of verbs such as:

mlatu
: ‚Ä¶ is a cat, to be a cat

citka
: ‚Ä¶ eats ‚Ä¶

prami
: ‚Ä¶ loves ‚Ä¶

klama
: ‚Ä¶ come to ‚Ä¶

Dictionaries can present verbs with symbols such as $x_1$, $x_2$ etc.:

prami
: $x_1$ loves $x_2$

karce
: $x_1$ is a car ‚Ä¶

citka
: $x_1$ eats $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

klama
: $x_1$ comes to $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

These $x_1$, $x_2$, and so on are called _places_, _roles of relation_ or _arguments_, and they represent the order in which we place nouns or pronouns in the sentence. For example:

> **mi prami do**
> _I love you._

This sentence also implies that

- $x_1$ denotes _the one who loves_, and
- $x_2$ denotes _the one who is loved by_.

In other words, each relation has one or more roles, and those roles are specified and labeled as $x_1$, $x_2$, and so on. We put nouns and pronouns in order, thus filling these roles and giving a concrete meaning to the relation, thus forming a sentence.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    %%common settings
    subgraph bridi["<i>relation</i>#nbsp;"]
        x1("x#8321;")
        selbri
        x2("x#8322;")
    end
    subgraph sumti["<i>list of sumti</i>#nbsp;"]
        s1-.->x1
        s2-.->x2
    end
    classDef s fill:#6807F7,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:#fff;
    class s1 s;
    class s2 s;
    classDef x fill:#FFF863,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5 2;
    class x1 x;
    class x2 x;
    classDef blabi fill:#fff,stroke:#333;
    class selbri blabi;
    class bridi blabi;

    %% input your sumti:
    s1(mi)
    s2(do)
    %% input your selbri
    selbri[(prami)]

```

The advantage of such style of definitions is that all participants of a relation are in one definition.

We can also omit nouns making the sentence more vague:

> **carvi**
> _It is raining._
> `is rain, is raining`

(although time here is determined by context, it can also mean _It often rains_, _It was raining_, etc.)

> **prami do**
> _Someone loves you._
> `loves you`

All omitted places in a relation just mean **zo'e** = _something/someone_ so it means the same as

> **zo'e prami do**
> _Someone loves you._

And

> **prami**

is the same as

> **zo'e prami zo'e**
> _Someone loves someone._

Modal terms like **ca**, **fa'a** etc. add new places to relations, but they don't remove existing places of verbs. In

> **mi klama fa'a do**
> _I come towards you._

the second place of **klama** is still omitted. For example:

> **mi klama fa'a le cmana le zdani**
> _I come (in the direction of the mountain) to the home._


le cmana
: the mountain

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/cmana.svg" caption="cmana" definition="‚Ä¶ is a mountain"></pixra>

And here, the second place of **klama** is **do**. The sentence means that the mountain is just a direction, whereas the final point is you.

Here, the term **fa'a la cmana** (_in the direction of the mountain_) doesn't replace the second place of the verb **klama**. The second place of **klama** is **le zdani** here.

The sentence means that my home is simply located in the direction of the mountain, but it doesn't necessarily mean I want to reach that mountain. The final destination of me coming is not necessarily the mountain but the home.

Similarly, in

> **mi citka ba le nu mi cadzu**
> _I eat after I walk._

the second place of **citka** is still omitted. A new word **ba** with its argument **le nu mi cadzu** adds meaning to the sentence.

The order of arguments of compound verbs is the same as the one of the last verb word in it:

> **tu sutra bajra pendo mi**
> _That is my quickly running friend._
> `That is a quickly running friend of me.`

pendo
: ‚Ä¶ is a friend of ‚Ä¶ (someone)

So the order of arguments is the same as that of **pendo** alone.

### More than two places

There might be more than two places. For example:

> **mi pinxe le djacu le kabri**
> _I drink the water from the cup._

pinxe
: $x_1$ drinks $x_2$ from $x_3$

> **le kabri**
> _the cup_

In this case, there are three places, and if you want to exclude the second place in the middle, you have to use **zo'e**:
> **mi pinxe zo'e le kabri**
> _I drink \[something\] from the cup._

If we omit **zo'e**, we get something meaningless:

> **mi pinxe le kabri**
> _I drink the cup._

Another example:

> **mi plicru do le plise**
> _I give you the apples._

plicru
: $x_1$ gives, donates to $x_2$ some object $x_3$; $x_1$ allows someone $x_2$ to use $x_3$ 

### Relations inside relations

In
> **le nicte cu nu mi viska le lunra**
> *The night is when I see the Moon.*

we have

- **le nicte** as $x_1$ of the relation,
- **nu mi viska le lunra** as the main relation.

However, inside **nu mi viska le lunra**, we have another sentence with

- **mi** - $x_1$ of the inner relation,
- **viska** - the inner relation,
- **le lunra** - $x_2$ of the inner relation.

So, despite having an inner structure, **nu mi viska le lunra** is still a relation with its first term filled with **le nicte** in this case.

Similarly, in

> **mi citka ba le nu mi dansu**
> _I eat after I dance._

we have

- **mi** as $x_1$ of the relation,
- **citka** as the main relation construct,
- **ba le nu mi dansu** as a modal term of the main relation of the sentence.

Inside this term, we have:

- **mi** as $x_1$ of the relation inside the term
- **dansu** as the main relation construct inside the term.

Such "recursive" mechanism of wrapping relations into relations allows expressing complex ideas precisely.

### Why are verbs defined the way they are?

English uses a limited set of prepositions that are reused across various verbs and, thus, have no fixed meaning. For example, consider the English preposition _to_:

> _I speak to you._

<!-- -->
> _I come to you._
<!-- -->

> _To me it looks pretty._

In each of those examples, _to_ has a new role that is, at best, remotely similar to roles in other sentences.

It's important to note that other languages use different ways of marking roles of verbs that, in many cases, are very different from those used in English.

Lojban, for instance, marks core roles of relations by fully defining such relations with the roles placed in sequence (or marked with **fa**, **fe**, and so on):

klama
: $x_1$ comes to $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

tavla
: $x_1$ talks to $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

melbi
: $x_1$ is beautiful, pretty to $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

Such core roles are essential in defining relations.

However, there can be optional roles that make relations more precise:

> _I speak to you while I'm eating._
<!-- -->

> _It's hard to me because this thing is heavy._

In Lojban, a similar notion of such optional roles is expressed via separate relations or, for most common cases, with modal terms:

> **mi tavla do ze'a le nu mi citka**
> _I speak to you while I'm eating._
<!-- -->
> **nandu mi ri'a le nu ti tilju**
> _It's hard to me because this thing is heavy._

nandu
: $x_1$ is hard to $x_2$

tilju
: $x_1$ is heavy

Prepositions in English are similar to modal particles in Lojban, although a usual English preposition can have many meanings while in Lojban, every modal particle has only one (even if vague) meaning.

### General rules in the order of arguments

The order of places in verbs might be sometimes hard to remember, but let's not worry ‚Äî you don't need to remember all the places of all verbs. (Do you remember the meaning of hundreds of thousands of words in English?)

You may study places when you find them useful or when people use them in a dialogue with you.

Most verbs have two-three places.

Usually, you can guess the order using context and a few rules of thumb:

1. The first place is often the person or thing that does something or is something:

    **klama** = _$x_1$ goes ‚Ä¶_

2. The object of some action is usually just after the first place:

    **punji** = _$x_1$ puts $x_2$ on $x_3$_,

3. And the next place will usually be filled with the recipient:

    **punji** = _$x_1$ puts $x_2$ on $x_3$_,

4. Destination (_to_) places nearly always come before origin (_from_) places:

    **klama** = _$x_1$ goes to $x_2$ from $x_3$_

    <pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/klama_fi.svg" caption="le prenu cu klama fi le zarci" definition="The person goes out of the shop."></pixra>

5. Less-used places come towards the end. These tend to be things like _by standard_, _by means_ or _made of_.

The general idea is that first come the places which are most likely to be used.

No need to fill all places all the time. Unfilled places just have values irrelevant or obvious to the speaker (they take the value of **zo'e** = _something_).

### Infinitives

Infinitives are verbs that are often prefixed with _to_ in English. Examples include _I like to run_, with _to run_ being the infinitive.

> **le verba cu troci le ka cadzu**
> _The child is trying to walk._

le verba
: the child, the children

troci
: $x_1$ tries to do or to be $x_2$ (ka)

cadzu
: $x_1$ walks

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/troci_cadzu.svg" caption="le verba cu troci le ka cadzu" definition="The child tries to walk."></pixra>

The particle **ka** works much like nu, but it indicates that the noun on the left does or would do the action following **ka**. It makes the first noun of the outer verb (**troci** in this case) also the first omitted noun of the embedded verb started by **ka** (**cadzu** in this case), so you don't have to repeat this noun the second time.

Some verbs require only infinitives in some of their places. Definitions of such words mark such places with the term _property_ or **ka**. For example:

cinmo
: $x_1$ feels $x_2$ (ka)

This means that the infinitive in the second place ($x_2$) is applied to some place (most likely, the first place, $x_1$). Cases where the infinitive is applied to places other than $x_2$ are rare and are explained for corresponding verbs or in the case of verbs invented unofficially, can be deduced from common sense.

Note that only the first unfilled place of the embedded relation takes the meaning of the outer place:

> **mi troci le ka do prami**
> _I try to be loved by you._

tcidu
: $x_1$ reads $x_2$ from $x_3$

Here, the first unfilled place is the second place of **prami**, thus it takes the value **mi** (_I_).

It is also possible by using the pronoun **ce'u** to explicitly mark a place that has to be applied to some outer noun:

> **mi troci le ka do prami ce'u**
> _I try to be loved by you._

Another example:

> **mi cinmo le ka xebni ce'u**
> **mi cinmo le ka se xebni**
> _I feel like someone hates me._
> _I feel being hated._

### Types of places

The dictionary often mentions other types of places, for example:

djica
: $x_1$ wants $x_2$ (event)

This _event_ means that you have to fill the place with a noun that represents an event. For instance:

le nicte
: nighttime

le nu mi dansu
: me dancing

So we get

> **mi djica le nicte**
> _I want the nighttime event._

<!-- -->

> **do djica le nu mi dansu**
> _You want me to dance._

In Lojban, it is not allowed to say, for example:


> **mi djica le plise**
> _I want the apple._ <div class="naldra"></div> 

because you want to do something with the apple or you want some event happening with the apple, such as:

> **mi djica le nu mi citka le plise**
> _I want to eat the apple._
> `I want that I eat the apple.`

### Raising

> **mi stidi le ka klama le barja**
> _I suggest going to the pub._

stidi
: $x_1$ suggest action $x_2$ (property) to $x_3$

> **mi stidi tu'a le barja**
> _I suggest the pub._

tu'a le barja
: something about the pub

> **mi djica le nu mi citka le plise**
> _I want to eat an apple._

<!-- -->

> **mi djica tu'a le titla**
> _I want the sweetie._

tu'a le titla
: something about the sweetie

titla
: ‚Ä¶ is sweet, ‚Ä¶ is a sweetie

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/djica_tuha_le_titla.svg" caption="le prenu cu djica tu'a le titla" definition="The person wants the sweetie."></pixra>

Place structure may put too much burden on specifying actions or events. Sometimes we want to specify only some object in those events or places and skip describing the action or the event altogether.

In the examples above _I suggest the pub._ most likely implies going to the pub and _I want the apple._ implies eating it.

However, the Lojban verb **stidi** requires a property in its $x_2$ place. Similarly, **djica** requires an event in its $x_2$ place.

The short so called qualifier word **tu'a** before a term implies an abstraction (property, event, or proposition) but selects only this term from this abstraction skipping the rest. It can be vaguely translated as _something about_:

> **mi stidi tu'a le barja**
> _I suggest something about the pub (maybe visiting it, meeting near it etc.)._

<!-- -->

> **mi djica tu'a le plise**
> _I want something about the apple (probably, eating it, maybe chewing it, licking it, throwing it at your friend etc.)_

When skipping abstractions only context tell us what was skipped.

### Places for nouns

How do we say _You are my friend_ ?

> **do pendo mi**
> _You are my friend._
> `You are a friend of me.`

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/pendo.svg" caption="le pendo" definition="the friend / the friends"></pixra>

And now, how do we say _My friend is smart._?

> **le pendo be mi cu stati**
> _My friend is smart._

So when we convert a verb into a noun (**pendo** ‚Äî _to be a friend_ into **le pendo** ‚Äî _a friend_), we can still retain other places of that verb by placing **be** after it.

By default it attaches the second place ($x_2$). We can attach more places by separating them with **bei**:

> **mi plicru do le plise**
> _I give you the apple._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/plicru.svg" caption="le prenu cu plicru le pendo le plise" definition="The person gives to the friend the apple."></pixra>
<!-- -->

> **le plicru be mi bei le plise**
> _The grantor of the apple to me_

<!-- -->

> **le plicru be mi bei le plise cu pendo mi**
> _The giver of the apple to me is my friend._
> `The one who gives me the apple is a friend of mine.`

Another example:

<!-- > **le pendo be mi cu tavla**
> _The friends of mine are talking._
> **le pendo mi cu tavla**
> **le pendo cu tavla mi**
> _The friends are talking to me._ -->

> **mi klama le pendo be do**
> _I come to a friend of yours._

klama
: $x_1$ comes to $x_2$ from $x_3$ ‚Ä¶

We can't omit **be** because **le pendo do** are two independent places:

> **mi klama le pendo do**
> _I come to a friend from you._

Here, **do** took the third place of **klama** since it's not bound to _pendo_ via **be**.

Neither could we use **nu** because **le nu pendo do** is the event of someone being a friend of yours.

So **le pendo be do** is the correct solution.

Another example:

> **la .lojban. cu bangu mi**
> _Lojban is my language._
> `Lojban is a language of me.`

However,

> **mi nelci le bangu be mi**
> _I like my language._

Using **be** for verbs not converted to nouns has no effect: **mi nelci be do** is the same as **mi nelci do**.

### Relative clauses

> **le prenu poi pendo mi cu tavla mi**
> _The person that is friend of mine talks to me._

<!-- -->

> **le prenu noi pendo mi cu tavla mi**
> _The person, who incidentally is a friend of mine, talks to me._

blabi
: ‚Ä¶ is white

In the first sentence, the word _that_ is essential to identifying the person in question. It clarifies whom among the people in the context we are talking about. We choose only those who are my friends out of probably many people around. Maybe there is only one person around that is my friend.

As for _who is incidentally a friend of mine_ from the second sentence, it just provides additional information about the person. It doesn't help us identify the person. For example, this might happen when all the people around are my friends.

**poi pendo mi** is a relative clause, a relation attached to the right of the noun **le prenu**. It ends just before the next word **cu**:

> **le prenu (poi pendo mi) cu tavla mi**
> _The person that is friend of mine talks to me._

In Lojban, we use **poi** for relative clauses that identify entities (objects, people or events) and **noi** for incidental information.

> **la .bob. ba co'a speni le ninmu poi pu xabju le nurma**
> _Bob will marry a girl who lived in the country._

xabju
: ‚Ä¶ lives in ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ inhabits ‚Ä¶ (place, object)

le nurma
: the rural area

This sentence doesn't exclude Bob marrying someone else as well! Removing the relative clause with **poi** changes the meaning:

> **la .bob. ba co'a speni le ninmu**
> _Bob will marry a girl._

Another example:

> **le prenu poi gleki cu ze'u renvi**
> _People (which ones?) who are happy live long._

ze'u
: modal term: for a long time

renvi
: to survive

Removing the relative clause with **poi** changes the meaning:

> **le prenu ze'u renvi**
> _The people live long._

On the other hand, relative clauses with **noi** contain just additional information about the noun to which they are attached. That noun is sufficiently defined by itself so that removing a relative clause with **noi** doesn't change its meaning:


> **mi nelci la .doris. noi mi ta'e zgana bu'u le panka**
> _I like Doris whom I habitually see in the park._
> _I like Doris. What else can I say about her? I habitually see her in the park._

zgana
: to observe (using any senses)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/panka_ninmu.svg" caption="le prenu noi mi ta'e zgana bu'u le panka" definition="The person whom I habitually see in the park."></pixra>

Removing the relative clause with **noi** retains the meaning: _I like Doris._

In spoken English, the distinction is often achieved using intonation or by guessing. Also, relative clauses with **noi** are traditionally separated with commas in English. They use _which_ or _who_, and the word _that_ is not used in them.

Let's have another example.

> **mi klama le pa tricu**
> _I come to the tree._

<!-- -->

> **le pa tricu cu barda**
> _The tree is big._

le pa tricu
: the tree (one tree)

barda
: $x_1$ is big/large

And now let's join those two sentences:

> **le tricu noi mi klama ke'a cu barda**
> _The tree, to which I come, is big._

Note the word **ke'a**. We move the second sentence about the same tree into a relative clause and replace the noun **le tricu** with **ke'a** in the relative clause. So the pronoun **ke'a** is like _who_ and _which_ in English. It points back to the noun to which the relative clause is attached.

So literally our Lojbanic sentence sounds like

> _The tree, such that I go to which, is big._

**ke'a** can be dropped if context is sufficient enough. The two following sentences mean the same:

> **le prenu poi pendo mi cu tavla mi**
> **le prenu poi ke'a pendo mi cu tavla mi**
> _The person that is friend of mine talks to me._

**ke'a** is often assumed to go to the first unfilled place:

> **mi nelci la .doris. noi mi ta'e zgana bu'u le panka**
> **mi nelci la .doris. noi mi ta'e zgana ke'a bu'u le panka**
> _I like Doris whom I habitually see in the park._

Here, **mi** fills the first place of the verb **ta'e zgana** (_‚Ä¶ habitually sees ‚Ä¶_), thus, **ke'a** is assumed for the next, second place.

Relative clauses like usual relations can contain constructs with modal terms:

> **le tricu noi mi pu klama ke'a ca le cabdei cu barda**
> _The tree, to which I went today, is big._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_tricu_cu_barda.svg" caption="le tricu cu barda" definition="The tree is big."></pixra>

le cabdei
: the day of today

Note that **ca le cabdei** belongs to the relative clause. Compare:

> **le tricu noi mi pu klama ke'a cu barda ca le cabdei**
> _The tree, to which I went, is big today._

The meaning has changed a lot.

Finally, **voi** is used to form **le**-like nouns but with relative clauses:

> **ti voi le nu ke'a cisma cu pluka mi cu zutse tu**
> _These ones whose smile pleases me are sitting down._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/voi.svg" caption="mi nelci ti voi le nu ke'a cisma cu pluka mi" definition="I like these whose smiles pleases me."></pixra>

ti
: this one near me, these ones near me

cisma
: $x_1$ smiles

pluka
: $x_1$ is pleasant to $x_2$

zutse
: $x_1$ sits, is sitting on $x_2$

Here, **voi** defines the object near me.

Compare it to:

> **ti poi le nu ke'a cisma cu pluka mi cu zutse**
> _Of these ones those whose smile pleases me are sitting down._

**poi** restricts the selection to those described in the relative clause.
This example might imply that there are many objects (people etc.) around me but with **poi** I select only necessary ones.

Compare it to:

> **ti noi le nu ke'a cisma cu pluka mi cu zutse**
> _These ones (who are incidentally such that their smile pleases me) are sitting down._

**noi** simply adds incidental information that is not necessary to determine what **ti** (_these ones_) refers to. Perhaps, there is nobody else around to describe.

Finally, just like **nu** has the right border marker **kei**, we have 

ku'o
: right border marker for **poi**, **noi** and **voi**.

> **mi tavla la .doris. noi ca zutse tu ku'o .e la .alis. noi ca cisma**
> _I talk to Doris, who is now sitting over there, and Alice who now smiles._

Notice that without **ku'o** we would have **tu** (_over there_) joined together with **la .alis.** (_Alice_) leading to a weird meaning:

> **mi tavla la .doris. noi ca zutse tu .e la .alis. noi ca cisma**
> _I talk to Doris, who is now sitting over there and on top of Alice (who now smiles)._

Notice the **zutse tu .e la .alis.** part.

For all of **poi**, **noi** and **voi** the right border marker is still the same: **ku'o**.

### Short relative clauses. ‚Äò_About_‚Äô

Sometimes, you might need to attach an additional noun or pronoun to another noun:

> **mi djuno le vajni pe do**
> _I know something important about you._

le vajni
: something important

**pe** and **ne** are similar to **poi** and **noi**, but they connect nouns (and pronouns) to nouns:

> **le pa penbi pe mi cu xunre**
> _The pen that is mine is red._ <span>(_mine_ is essential to identifying the pen in question)</span>

<!-- -->

> **le pa penbi ne mi cu xunre**
> _The pen, which is mine, is red._ <span>(additional information)</span>

ne
: which is about, has relation to ‚Ä¶ (a noun/pronoun follows)

pe
: that is about, has relation to ‚Ä¶ (a noun/pronoun follows)

> **le pa penbi ne mi ge'u .e le pa fonxa ne do cu xunre**
> _The pen, which is mine, and the phone, which is yours, are red._

ge'u
: right border marker for **pe**, **ne**.

### ¬´**be**¬ª and ¬´**pe**¬ª

Note that relative clauses are attached to nouns, while **be** is a part of the verb.

Actually, **le bangu pe mi** is a better translation of _my language_, since, like in English, the two nouns are related to each other in a vague way.

However, you can say **le birka be mi** as _my arm_. Even if you saw off your arm, it will still be yours. That's why **birka** has a place of the owner:

birka
: $x_1$ is an arm of $x_2$

Let's show once again that a construct with **be** is a part of the verb, whereas **pe**, **ne**, **poi** and **noi** attach to nouns:

> **le pa melbi be mi fonxa pe le pa pendo be mi cu barda**
> `The beautiful to me phone of the friend of mine is big.`

Here, **be mi** is attached to the verb **melbi** = _to be beautiful to ‚Ä¶ (someone)_ and thus creates a new verb **melbi be mi** = _to be beautiful to me_. But **pe le pa pendo be mi** (_of my friend_) is applied to the whole noun **le pa melbi be mi fonxa** (_the beautiful to me phone_).

It can also happen that we need to attach **be** to a verb, transform that verb into a noun and then attach **pe** to that noun:

> **le pa pendo be do be'o pe la .paris. cu stati**
> _The friend of yours who is related to Paris is smart._

<!-- -->

> **le pu plicru be do bei le pa plise be'o pe la .paris. cu stati**
> _Who gave you the apple (and who is related to Paris) is smart._

be'o
: right border marker for the string of nouns attached with **be** and **bei**

In these examples, **pe la .paris.** is attached to the whole noun **le pa pendo be do be'o** and to the whole noun **le pu plicru be do bei le pa plise be'o**.

In these two examples, your friend has some relation to Paris (maybe, he/she is from Paris).

Compare it to:

> **le pa pendo be do pe la .paris. cu stati**
> _The friend of you (you who is related to Paris) is smart._

<!-- -->

> **le pu plicru be do bei le pa plise pe la .paris. cu stati**
> _Who gave you the apple (the apple that is related to Paris) is smart._

In these last two examples, however, either you are related to Paris or the apple.

### ‚Äò_Alice is a teacher_‚Äô and ‚Äò_Alice is the teacher_‚Äô

In English, the verb _is, are, to be_ makes a noun work like a verb. In Lojban, even such concepts as _cat_ (**mlatu**), _person_ (**prenu**), _house_ (**dinju**), _home_ (**zdani**) function like verbs by default. Only pronouns work as nouns.

However, here are three cases:

> **la .alis. cu ctuca**
> _Alice teaches._

<!-- -->

> **la .alis. cu me le ctuca**
> _Alice is one of the teachers._

me
: ‚Ä¶ is among ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ is one of ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ are members of ‚Ä¶ (noun follows)

> **la .alis. ta'e ctuca**
> _Alice habitually teaches._

ta'e
: modal particle: the event happens habitually

> **la .alis. cu du le ctuca**
> _Alice is the teacher._

du
: ‚Ä¶ is identical to ‚Ä¶

The particle **me** takes a noun after it and indicates that there are likely other teachers, and Alice is one among them.

The particle **du** is used when Alice is, for example, the teacher that we have been searching for or talking about. It indicates identity.

Thus, **me** and **du** can sometimes correspond to what in English we express using the verb _to be/is/was_.

In Lojban, we prioritize the meaning of what we intend to say, rather than relying on how it is literally expressed in English or other languages.

Other examples:

> **mi me la .bond.**
> _I am Bond._

<!-- -->

> **mi du la .kevin.**
> _I am Kevin (the one you needed)._

<!-- -->

> **ti du la .alis. noi mi ta'e zgana bu'u le panka**
> _This is Alice whom I habitually see in the park._

**noi du** and **poi du** are used to introduce alternate names for something. They correspond to English _namely, i.e._:

> **la .alis. cu penmi le prenu noi du la .abdul.**
> _Alice met the person, namely Abdul._

When using **me**, you can connect several nouns with _and_:

> **tu me le pendo be mi be'o .e le tunba be mi**
> _Those are some (or all) of my friends and my siblings._

tunba
: $x_1$ is a sibling of $x_2$

### Modal particles inside nouns

We can place a modal particle not only before the main relation construct of the sentence but also at the end of it, producing the same result:

> **mi ca tcidu**
> **mi tcidu ca**
> _I (now read)._

tcidu
: to read (some text)

When using **nu**, we create a relation describing some event. Notice the difference between these two examples:

> **le nu tcidu ca cu nandu**
> _The current reading is complicated, difficult._

<!-- -->

> **le nu tcidu cu ca nandu**
> _The reading is now complicated._

Other examples:

> **mi klama le pa cmana pu**
> _I went to the mountain._
> `I go to a mountain (in the past).`

<!-- -->

> **le nu mi klama le pa cmana pu cu pluka**
> _That I went to a mountain is pleasant._

When not using **nu**, we don't have event relations. Nouns start with **le** and end with their verb (whether it's a single or a compound verb, with **be** construct in them or not). Thus, we can put term particles before a verb in a noun only before that verb:

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/coha_purdi.svg" caption="le pu kunti tumla ca purdi" definition="What was a desert is now a garden."></pixra>

> **le pu kunti tumla ca purdi**
> _What was a desert is now a garden._

So **pu** belongs to **le kunti tumla** and **ca** belongs to **purdi** (as **le pu kunti tumla** can't add **ca** at the end).

This doesn't contradict using **be** after the verb since, with **be**, you change the verb: **bangu be mi** is considered one verb.

Having several modal particles in order is not a problem:
> **le pu ze'u kunti tumla ca purdi**
> _What was a desert for a long time is now a garden._

ze'u
: modal term: for a long time

Placing term particles after nouns binds them to outer verbs:

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/cohu_purdi.svg" caption="le kunti tumla pu purdi" definition="The desert was a garden."></pixra>

> **le kunti tumla pu purdi**
> **(le kunti tumla) pu purdi**
> _The desert was a garden._

### New nouns from places of the same verb

> **do plicru mi ti**
> _You grant me this._

<!-- -->

> **mi se plicru ti do**
> _I'm granted this by you._

plicru
: $x_1$ gives $x_2$ something $x_3$ for use

We can swap the first two places in the verb using **se** and thus change the place structure.

**do plicru mi ti** means exactly the same as **mi se plicru do ti**. The difference is solely in style.

You may want to change things around for different emphasis, for example, to mention the more important things in a sentence first. So the following pairs mean the same thing:

> **mi prami do**
> _I love you._

<!-- -->

> **do se prami mi**
> _You are loved by me._

<!-- -->

> **le nu mi tadni la .lojban. cu xamgu mi**
> _My study of Lojban is good for me._

xamgu
: ‚Ä¶ is good for (someone)

> **mi se xamgu le nu mi tadni la .lojban.**
> _For me, it's good to study Lojban._

The same can be done with nouns:

le plicru
: those who give, the givers, the donors, the donators

le se plicru
: those who are given to, recipients of gifts

le te plicru
: those objects that are given for use, gifts

**te** swaps the first and third places of verbs.

As we know, when we add **le** in front of a verb, it becomes a noun. So

- **le plicru** means _those which could fit in the first place of **plicru**_
- **le se plicru** means _those which could fit in the second place of **plicru**_
- **le te plicru** means _those which could fit in the third place of **plicru**_

Thus, in Lojban, we don't need separate words for _donor_, _recipient_, and _gift_. We reuse the same verb and save a lot of effort because of such clever design. Indeed, we can't imagine a gift without implying that someone gave it or will give it. When useful phenomena are interconnected, Lojban reflects this.

For the ease of understanding and memorizing predicate words prefixed with **se**, **te** are put into the dictionary in entries for many verbs together with their definitions, although you can figure out their meaning yourself.

### Changing other places in main relations

The series **se, te, ve, xe** (in alphabetical order) consists of particles that change places in main relations:

- **se** swaps the first and second places
- **te** swaps the first and third places
- **ve** swaps the first and fourth places
- **xe** swaps the first and fifth places.

> **mi zbasu le pa stizu le mudri**  
> _I made the chair out of the piece of wood._

zbasu
: $x_1$ builds, makes $x_2$ out of $x_3$

le pa stizu
: the chair

le mudri
: the piece of wood

> **le mudri cu te zbasu le stizu mi**  
> _The piece of wood is what the chair is made of by me._

The **mi** has now moved to the third place of the relation and can be dropped if we are too lazy to specify who made the chair or if we just don't know who made it:

> **le mudri cu te zbasu le stizu**  
> _The piece of wood is the material of the chair._

Similarly to our example with **le se plicru** (_the recipient_) and **le te plicru** (_the gift_), we can use **te**, **ve**, **xe** to derive more words from other places of verbs:

klama
: $x_1$ goes to $x_2$ from $x_3$ via $x_4$ by means $x_5$

Thus, we can derive that

le klama
: the comer / the comers

le se klama
: the destination place

le te klama
: the place of origin of the movement

le ve klama
: the route

le xe klama
: the means of coming

**le xe klama** and the fifth place of **klama** can denote any means of movement, like driving a car or walking on foot.

**se** is used more frequently than the other particles for swapping places.

### Free word order: tags for places

Usually, we don't need all the places of a verb, so we can omit the unnecessary ones by replacing them with **zo'e**. However, we can use _place tags_ to explicitly refer to a needed place. Place tags work like modal particles but deal with the place structure of relations:

> **mi prami do** is the same as
> **fa mi prami fe do**
> _I love you._

- **fa** marks the first place of a verb ($x_1$)
- **fe** marks the second place ($x_2$)
- **fi** marks the third place ($x_3$)
- **fo** marks the fourth place ($x_4$)
- **fu** marks the fifth place ($x_5$)

More examples:

> **mi klama fi le tcadu**
> _I go from the city._

**fi** marks **le tcadu** as the third place of **klama** (the origin of movement). Without **fi**, the sentence would turn into **mi klama le tcadu**, meaning _I go to the city._

> **mi pinxe fi le kabri** is the same as
> **mi pinxe zo'e le kabri**
> _I drink (something) from the cup._

pinxe
: $x_1$ drinks $x_2$ from $x_3$

le kabri
: the cup, the glass

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/pinxe_fi_le_kabri.svg" caption="le prenu cu pinxe fi le kabri" definition="The person drinks from the glass."></pixra>

> **mi tugni zo'e le nu vitke le rirni**
> **mi tugni fi le nu vitke le rirni**
> _I agree (with someone) about visiting parents._

tugni
: $x_1$ agrees with someone $x_2$ about $x_3$ (proposition)

le rirni
: the parent / the parents

With place tags, we can move places around:

> **fe mi fi le plise pu plicru**
> _Someone gave the apple to me._

Here,

- **le plise** = _the apple_, we put it into the third place of **plicru**, what is given
- **mi** = _me_, we put it into the second place of **plicru**, the recipient.

As we can see in the last example, we can't even reflect the order of words in its English translation.

Extensive use of place tags can make our speech harder to perceive, but they allow for more freedom.

Unlike **se** series, using place tags like **fa** doesn't change the place structure.

---

We can use place tags inside nouns by placing them after **be**:

> **le pa klama be fi le tcadu cu pendo mi**
> _The one who comes to the city is my friend._

---

We may also put all the nouns of one main relation in front of the sentence tail (preserving their relative order). Because of this freedom, we can say:

> **mi do prami** which is the same as
> **mi do cu prami** which is the same as
> **mi prami do**
> _I love you._

<!-- -->

> **ko kurji ko** is the same as
> **ko ko kurji**
> _Take care of yourself._

The following sentences are also equal in meaning:

> **mi plicru do le pa plise**
> _I give you the apple._

<!-- -->

> **mi do cu plicru le pa plise**
> _I you give the apple._

<!-- -->

> **mi do le pa plise cu plicru**
> _I you the apple give._


### Prenex

Prenex is a "prefix" of relation, in which you can declare variables to be used later:

> **pa da poi pendo mi zo'u da tavla da**
> _There is someone who is a friend of me such that he/she talks to himself/herself_

zo'u
: prenex separator

da
: pronoun: variable.

The pronoun **da** is translated as _there is something/someone ‚Ä¶_ If we use **da** the second time in the same relation, it always refers to the same thing as the first **da**:

> **mi djica le nu su'o da poi kukte zo'u mi citka da**
> _I wish there was at least something tasty so that I eat it._

su'o
: number: at least 1

If the variable is used in the same relation and not in any embedded relations, then you can omit the prenex altogether:

> **mi djica le nu su'o da poi kukte zo'u mi citka da**
> **mi djica le nu mi citka su'o da poi kukte**
> _I wish there was at least something tasty so that I eat it._
> _I wish for something to be so that I eat it._

Both examples mean the same, in both cases **su'o da** denotes _there is (were/will be) something or somebody_.

However, prenex is useful and necessary when you need to use **da** deep inside your relation, i.e. within embedded relations:

> **su'o da poi kukte zo'u mi djica le nu mi citka da**
> _There is at least something tasty: I wish I ate it, I want to eat it._
> _There is something tasty I wish to eat._

Notice how the meaning changes. Here, we can't omit the prenex because it will change the meaning of the previous example.

More examples:

> **mi tavla**
> _I talk._

<!-- -->

> **mi tavla su'o da**
> **mi tavla da**
> _There is someone I talk to._

By default, **da** as a pronoun alone means the same as **su'o da** (_there is at least one ‚Ä¶_) unless an explicit number is used.

> **da tavla da**
> _Someone talks to themselves._

<!-- -->

> **da tavla da da**
> _Someone talks to themselves about themselves._

tavla
: $x_1$ talks to someone $x_2$ about topic $x_3$

> **pa da poi ckape zo'u mi djica le nu da na ku fasnu**
> _There is one dangerous thing: I wish it never happens._

**da** doesn't imply any particular objects or events, which is often useful:

> **xu do tavla su'o da poi na ku slabu do**
> _Do you talk to someone not familiar to you? (no particular person in mind is described)._

<!-- -->

> **.e'u mi joi do casnu bu'u su'o da poi drata**
> _Let's discuss in another place (no particular place in mind)_

### Nouns of existence

> **pa da poi me le pendo be mi zo'u mi prami da**
> _There is someone who is a friend of mine, such that I love them._

Since **da** is used only once, we might be tempted to get rid of the prenex. But how should we handle the relative clause **poi pendo mi** (_who is a friend of mine_)?

Thankfully, in Lojban there is a shortcut:

> **pa da poi me le pendo be mi zo'u mi prami da**
> **mi prami pa le pendo be mi**
> _There is someone who is a friend of mine, such that I love them._

Both sentences mean the same.

Nouns starting with numbers like **pa le pendo** (_there is someone who is a friend of mine_), **ci le prenu** (_there are three people_) may refer to new entities every time they are used. That's why

> **pa le pendo be mi ca tavla pa le pendo be mi**
> _There is one friend of mine who talks to one friend of mine._

This sentence is not precise in telling whether it's your friend talking to himself/herself, or you are describing two friends of yours such that the first one is talking to your second one.

It's more reasonable to say:

> **le pa pendo be mi ca tavla ri**
> _The friend of mine is talking to himself/herself._

ri
: pronoun: refers to the previous noun excluding **mi**, **do**.

Here, **ri** refers to the previous noun: **le pa pendo** altogether.

Note the difference:

- **da** means _there is something/someone_, **da** always refers to the same entity when used more than once in the same relation.
- noun like **pa le mlatu** (with a bare number) is similar to using **pa da poi me le mlatu** but it can refer to new entities every time it is used.

> **mi nitcu le nu pa da poi mikce zo'u da kurju mi**
> _I need a doctor to take care of me (implying "any doctor will do")._

<!-- -->

> **pa da poi mikce zo'u mi nitcu le nu da kurju mi**
> _There is a doctor whom I need to take care of me._

One more example:

> **le nu pilno pa le bangu kei na ku banzu**
> _Using just one of the languages is not enough._

pilno
: ‚Ä¶ uses ‚Ä¶

banzu
: ‚Ä¶ is enough for purpose ‚Ä¶

Compare it to:

> **le nu pilno le pa bangu kei na ku banzu**
> _Using the language (the one in question) is not enough._

Nouns of existence are naturally used inside inner relations and with **tu'a**:

> **mi djica le nu mi citka pa le plise**
> _I want to eat an apple, some apple._

> **mi djica tu'a pa le plise**
> _I want something about an apple, some apple (probably, eating it, maybe chewing it, licking it, throwing it at your friend etc.)_

Notice the difference:

> **mi djica tu'a le pa plise**
> _I want something about the apple (the apple in question)._

### ‚Äò_I have an arm._‚Äô ‚Äò_I have a brother._‚Äô

The English verb _to have_ has several meanings. Let's list some of them.

> **pa da birka mi**
> _I have an arm._
> `There is something that is an arm of me`

birka
: $x_1$ is an arm of $x_2$

We use the same strategy for expressing family relationships:

> **pa da bruna mi**
> **mi se bruna pa da**
> _Someone is my brother._
> _I have one brother._
> `There is someone who is a brother of me`

<!-- -->

> **re lo bruna be mi cu clani**
> _I have two brothers, and they are tall._

clani
: $x_1$ is long, tall

So we don't need the verb _to have_ to denote such relationships. The same applies to other family members:

> **da mamta mi**
> **mi se mamta da**
> _I have a mother._

<!-- -->

> **da patfu mi**
> **mi se patfu da**
> _I have a father._

<!-- -->

> **da mensi mi**
> **mi se mensi da**
> _I have a sister._

<!-- -->

> **da panzi mi**
> **mi se panzi da**
> _I have a child (or children)._

panzi
: $x_1$ is a child, offspring of $x_2$

Note that using a number in front of **da** isn't necessary if the context is enough.

---

Another meaning of _to have_ is _to keep_:

> **mi ralte le pa gerku**
> _I have the dog._
> `I keep the dog`

<!-- -->

> **mi ralte le pa karce**
> _I have the car._

ralte
: $x_1$ keeps $x_2$ in their possession

---

If you own, possess something according to some law or documents, you should use **ponse**:

> **mi ponse le karce**
> _I own the car._
> _I have the car._

ponse
: $x_1$ owns $x_2$


### Scope

The order of 
* terms, starting with numbers,
* modal terms, and
* modal particles of relation constructs,

matters and should be read from left to right:

> **ci le pendo cu tavla re le verba**
> _There are three friends, each talking to two children._

The overall number of children here may be as high as six.

By using **zo'u**, we can make our sentence clearer:

> **ci da poi me le pendo ku'o re de poi me le verba zo'u da tavla de**
> _For three **da** which are among the friends, for two **de** which are among the children: **da** talks to **de**._

Here, we see that each of the friends is said to talk to two children, and it might be different children each time, with up to six children in total.

How then can we express the other interpretation, in which just two children are involved? We cannot merely reverse the order of variables in the prenex to:

> **re de poi me le verba ku'o ci da poi me le pendo zo'u da tavla de**
> _For two **de** which are among the children, for three **da** which are among the friends, **da** talks to **de**_

Although we have now limited the number of children to exactly two, we end up with an indeterminate number of friends, ranging from three to six. This distinction is called a ‚Äúscope distinction‚Äù: in the first example, **ci da poi me le pendo** is said to have a wider scope than **re de poi me le verba**, and therefore precedes it in the prenex. In the second example, the reverse is true.

To make the scope equal, we use a special conjunction **ce'e** connecting two nouns:

> **ci da poi me le pendo ce'e re de poi me le verba cu tavla**
> **ci le pendo ce'e re le verba cu tavla**
> _Three friends [and] two children, talk._

This picks out two groups, one of three friends and the other of two children, and says that each of the friends talks to each of the children.

The order matters with modal particles modifying main relation constructs too:

> **mi speni**
> _I am married, I have a wife or a husband._

<!-- -->

> **mi co'a speni**
> _I get married._

<!-- -->

> **mi mo'u speni**
> _I am widowed._

mo'u
: term: the event is completed

Now compare:

> **mi mo'u co'a speni**
> _I am newlywed._
> `I finished becoming a married person.`

> **mi co'a mo'u speni**
> _I get widowed._
> `I become finishing being married.`

If there are several modal particles in one sentence, the rule is that we read them from left to right together, thinking of it as a so-called _imaginary journey_. We begin at an implied point in time and space (the speaker's "now and here" if no noun follows), and then follow the modals one after another from left to right.

Let's take **mi mo'u co'a speni**.

**mo'u** means that an event is complete. Which event? The event **co'a speni** ‚Äî to become married. Hence, **mi mo'u co'a speni** means _I finish the process of becoming married_, i.e., _I am newlywed._

In such cases, we say that **co'a speni** is within the "scope" of **mo'u**.

    class t1 x;
    class brivla blabi;
```

In **mi co'a mo'u speni**, the order of events is different.

First, it is said that an event started (**co'a**), then it is stated that it is an event of finishing being married. Hence, **mi co'a mo'u speni** means _I get widowed_.

We can say that here **mo'u speni** is within the "scope" of **co'a**.

Another example:

> **mi co'a ta'e citka**
> _I start to habitually eat._

<!-- -->

> **mi ta'e co'a citka**
> _I habitually start to eat._

Examples with simple tenses:

> **mi pu ba klama le cmana**
> _It happened before I went to the mountain._
> `I in past: in future: go to the mountain.`

> **mi ba pu klama le cmana**
> _It will happen after I went to the mountain._
> `I in future: in past: go to the mountain.`

The rule of reading terms from left to right can be overridden by connecting modal particles with the conjunction **ce'e**:

> **mi ba ce'e pu klama le cmana**
> _I went and will go to the mountain._
> `I in future and in past: go to the mountain.`

> **mi cadzu ba le nu mi citka ce'e pu le nu mi sipna**
> _I walk after I eat and before I sleep._

### Modal particles + ¬´**da**¬ª + nouns that start with numbers

Like with modal terms, the position of **da** matters:

> **mi ponse da**
> _There is something I own._

<!-- -->

> **mi co'u ponse da**
> _I lost all my property._

ponse
: $x_1$ owns $x_2$

co'u
: modal term: the event stops

This might look like a mind-breaking example. Here, a person was able to say _I own something._ But then for everything the person owned, this situation ended.

Another example:

> **ro da vi cu cizra**
> _Everything is strange here._
> `Every thing here strange`

vi
: here, at a short distance

cizra
: $x_1$ is strange

> **vi ku ro da cizra**
> _Here, everything is strange._
> `Here: every thing strange`

Did you catch the difference?

1. _Everything is strange here_ means that if something is not strange somewhere, it becomes strange at this place.
2. _Here, everything is strange_ simply describes those objects or events that are here (and they are strange). We don't know anything about others in other places.

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/viku_cizra.svg" caption="vi ku ro da cizra" definition="Here, everything is strange."></pixra>

Another example with a noun starting with a number:

> **pa le prenu ta'e jundi**
> _There is one person who is habitually attentive._

‚Äî it is the same person who is attentive.

> **ta'e ku pa le prenu cu jundi**
> _It habitually happens that there is one person who is attentive._

‚Äî it is always that one person is attentive. People may change, but there is always one attentive person.

### Generic nouns. ‚ÄòI like cats (in general)‚Äô. Sets

> **mi nelci le'e mlatu**
> _I like cats._

We've seen **le** being mostly translated as the English _the_. However, in some cases, we might want to describe a typical object or event that best exemplifies a type of object or event in our context. In this case, we replace **le** with **le'e**:

> **mi nelci le'e badna .i mi na ku nelci le'e plise**
> _I like bananas. I don't like apples._

I might not have any bananas or apples at hand. I'm simply talking about bananas and apples as I understand, remember, or define them.

To make a noun describing the set of objects or events (from which we derive such a typical element), we use the word **le'i**:

> **le danlu pendo pe mi cu mupli le ka ca da co'a morsi kei le'i mabru**
> _My pet is an example that at one point mammals die._

danlu
: $x_1$ is a mammal

morsi
: $x_1$ is dead

co'a morsi
: $x_1$ dies

ca da
: at some point in time

mupli
: $x_1$ is an example of $x_2$ (property) among $x_3$ (set)

Dictionaries specify places of verbs that have to be filled with sets.

### Masses

> **lei prenu pu sruri le jubme**
> _The people surrounded the table._
> `The mass of people did surround the table.`

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sruri.svg" caption="The people surrounded the table." definition="The people surrounded the table."></pixra>

We use **lei** instead of **le** to show that the mass of objects is relevant to the action, but not those objects individually. Compare:

We use **lei** instead of **le** to show that the mass of objects is relevant to the action, but not those objects individually. Compare:

**The people were silent.**
<!-- -->
**The crowd was silent.**

le prenu
: the person, the people

lei prenu
: the crowd, the mass of people

smaji
: $x_1$ is silent

**The snakes surrounded the rod.**
_Each of the snakes surrounded the rod._

‚Äî here, each snake surrounded the rod probably by curling around it.

**The snakes surrounded the rod.**
_The snakes together as a mass surrounded the rod._

‚Äî here, we don't care about individual snakes, but we state that snakes as a mass surrounded the rod.

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sruri_since.svg" caption="The snake surrounded the person." definition="The snake surrounded the person."></pixra>

**The two rings is a symbol of Lojban.**
<!-- -->
**It's not true that each of the two rings is a symbol of Lojban.**

djine
: $x_1$ is a ring

Indeed, only the two rings together form a symbol.

Consider a sentence:

_Apples are heavy._

Does it mean that each apple is heavy, or does it mean that they are heavy if taken together?

In Lojban, we can easily distinguish between these two cases:

**Each of the three apples is heavy.**
**Each of the apples is heavy.**
<!-- -->
**The three apples are heavy in total.**
(so that every apple might be light, but together they are heavy)

tilju
: $x_1$ is heavy

As you can see, there is an important difference between describing one object of a mass or describing the mass.


### Masses

> **lei prenu pu sruri le jubme**
> _The people surrounded the table._
> `The mass of people did surround the table.`

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sruri.svg" caption="lei prenu cu sruri le jubme" definition="The people surrounded the table."></pixra>

We use **lei** instead of **le** to show that the mass of objects is relevant to the action, but not those objects individually. Compare:

> **le prenu pu smaji**
> _The people were silent._
<!-- -->
> **lei prenu pu smaji**
> _The crowd was silent._

le prenu
: the person, the people

lei prenu
: the crowd, the mass of people

smaji
: $x_1$ is silent

> **le since cu sruri le garna**
> _The snakes surrounded the rod._
> _Each of the snakes surrounded the rod._

‚Äî here, each snake surrounded the rod probably by curling around it.

> **lei since cu sruri le garna**
> _The snakes surrounded the rod._
> _The snakes together as a mass surrounded the rod._

‚Äî here, we don't care about individual snakes, but we state that snakes as a mass surrounded the rod.

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sruri_since.svg" caption="le pa since cu sruri le prenu" definition="The snake surrounded the person."></pixra>

> **lei re djine cu sinxa la .lojban.**
> _The two rings is a symbol of Lojban._

<!-- -->

> **na ku re le djine cu sinxa la lojban**
> _It's not true that each of the two rings is a symbol of Lojban._

djine
: $x_1$ is a ring

Indeed, only the two rings together form a symbol.

Consider a sentence:

> _Apples are heavy._

Does it mean that each apple is heavy, or does it mean that they are heavy if taken together?

In Lojban, we can easily distinguish between these two cases:

> **le ci plise cu tilju**
> _Each of the three apples is heavy._

> **le plise cu tilju**
> _Each of the apples is heavy._

<!-- -->

> **lei ci plise cu tilju**
> _The three apples are heavy in total._
> (so that every apple might be light, but together they are heavy)

tilju
: $x_1$ is heavy

As you can see, there is an important difference between describing an object within a mass and describing the mass itself.

### Numbers in places

> **le ci plise cu grake li pa no no**
> _Each of the three apples weigh 100 grams._

<!-- -->

> **lei ci plise cu grake li pa no no**
> _The three apples weigh 100 grams in total._
> (so that every apple weighs ‚âà 33 grams on average)

grake
: $x_1$ weighs $x_2$ (number) grams

When a place of a relation requires a number as mentioned by the dictionary, then to use that number, we prefix it with the word **li**.

**li** is a prefix signaling that a number, a timestamp, or some math expression is coming.

> **li mu no**
> _Number 50._

A simple **mu no** not being prefixed by **li** would be used to denote 50 objects or events.

## Lesson 3. Quoting. Questions. Interjections

### ¬´**sei**¬ª: comments to the text

The particle **sei** allows inserting a comment about our attitude regarding what is said in a relation:

> **do jinga sei mi gleki**
> _You won! (I'm happy about that!)_

However:

> **do jinga sei la .ian. cu gleki**
> _You won! (And Yan is happy about that!)_

Like with nouns formed using **le**, the relation formed with **sei** must end in a verb.

> **la .alis. cu prami sei la .bob. cu gleki la .kevin.**

Let's add brackets to make it more easily readable.

> **la .alis. cu prami (sei la .bob. cu gleki) la .kevin.**
> _Alice loves (Bob is happy) Kevin._
> _Alice loves Kevin (Bob is happy)._

We can add more nouns to the verb with **be** and **bei** as we do for nouns:

> **do jinga sei mi zausku be fo la fircku**
> _You won! (I'll post congrats on Facebook)_

la fircku
: Facebook

zausku
: x1 praises x2 for audience x3 via means x4
<!-- style fixes -->

### Quotation marks

For quoting text we place quotation particle **lu** before the quote and place **li'u** after it. The result is a noun representing a quoted text:

> **mi cusku lu mi prami do li'u**
> _I say "I love you."_

cusku
: $x_1$ expresses/says $x_2$ (quote) to audience $x_3$

A nice feature of Lojban is that **lu** ‚Äî ¬´quote¬ª and **li'u** ‚Äî ¬´unquote¬ª marks are pronounceable. It is quite handy since in spoken Lojban you don't have to change intonation to show where a quoted text starts and ends.

However, in written text that quotes a conversation, the author often pays reader's attention to the content of quotations. In such cases **sei** is preferred.

We can also nest quotations, for example:

> **la .ian. pu cusku lu la .djein. pu cusku lu coi li'u mi li'u**
> _Yan said "Jane said ‚ÄòHello‚Äô to me."_

which is similar to


> **la .ian. pu cusku lu la .djein. pu rinsa mi li'u**
> _Yan said "Jane greeted me."_

rinsa
: $x_1$ greets someone $x_2$

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/rinsa2.svg" caption="le prenu cu rinsa le pendo" definition="The person greets the friend."></pixra>

Note that in Lojban we distinguish things and their names:

> **lu le munje li'u cu cmalu**
> _"The universe" is small._

<!-- -->

> **le munje na ku cmalu**
> _The universe is not small._

le munje
: the universe, world

Here, the text _"the universe"_ is small whereas the universe is not.

---

Interjections and vocatives work like **sei** constructs:

> **je'u mi jinga sei ra cusku**
> _Truly, "I won", he said._

je'u
: interjection: truly

As you can see **je'u** is not his words. It's your attitude to the relation. If you want to quote "**je'u mi jinga**" use quotation marks getting:

> **lu je'u mi jinga li'u se cusku ra**
> _"Truly, I won", he said._

See the difference between the two examples?

Several common verbs related to talking:

> **ra pu retsku lu do klama ma li'u**
> _She asked "Where do you go?"_

<!-- -->

> **mi pu spusku lu mi klama le zdani li'u**
> _I replied "I am going home."_

<!-- -->

> **mi pu spuda le se retsku be ra le ka spusku lu mi klama le zdani li'u**
> _I replied to her question by saying in reply "I am going home."_

spuda
: $x_1$ replies to $x_2$ by doing $x_3$ (property of $x_1$)

The remaining three verbs have identical place structure:

cusku
: $x_1$ expresses/says $x_2$ (quote) to audience $x_3$

retsku
: $x_1$ asks $x_2$ (quote) to audience $x_3$

spusku
: $x_1$ replies/says answer $x_2$ (quote) to audience $x_3$

### ¬´**zo**¬ª ‚Äî quoting one word

**zo** is a quotation marker, just like **lu**. However, **zo** quotes only one word immediately after it. This means it does not have an unquote word like **li'u**: we already know where the quotation ends. Thus we save two syllables making our speech more concise.

> **zo .robin. cmene mi**
> _"Robin" is my name._
> _My name is Robin._

cmene
: $x_1$ (quote) is a name of $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

This is how you present yourself in Lojban using your Lojbanized name.If you have a name consisting of more than one verb word then use **lu ‚Ä¶ li'u**:

> **lu .robin.djonsyn. li'u cmene mi**
> _Robin Johnson is my name._

Another way is to use **me**.

> **mi me la .robin.djonsyn.**
> _I'm Robin Johnson._

Note that the first place of **cmene** is a quote, a text. Thus, we use not **la** (prefix for names) but **lu ‚Ä¶ li'u** or **zo** to make a quote and fill the first place of **cmene** with it. Thus, **mi me la .robin.** but

> **zo .robin. cmene mi**
> `"Robin" (quotation) is a name of me`

### Content questions

English also has a number of _wh-_ questions ‚Äî _who_, _what_ etc. In Lojban we use one word for all of these: **ma**. This is like an instruction to fill in the missing place. For example:

> **‚Äî do klama ma**
> **‚Äî la .london.**
> _‚Äî Where are you going?_
> _‚Äî London._

<!-- -->

> **‚Äî ma klama la .london.**
> **‚Äî la .kevin.**
> _‚Äî Who's going to London?_
> _‚Äî Kevin._

<!-- -->

> **‚Äî mi plicru do ma**
> **‚Äî le plise**
> <span>_‚Äî I give you what?_ (probably meaning _What was it I was supposed to be giving you?_)</span>
> _‚Äî The apple._

To translate _which/what_ we also use **ma**:

> **‚Äî ma gugde gi'e se xabju do**
> **‚Äî le gugde'usu**
> _‚Äî In what country do you live?_
> _‚Äî USA_
> `‚Äî What is a country and is inhabited by you`
> `‚Äî USA`

xabju
: ‚Ä¶ (someone) inhabits ‚Ä¶ (some place)

se xabju
: ‚Ä¶ (some place) is inhabited by ‚Ä¶ (someone)

**mo** is like **ma**, but questions the main relation, not a noun ‚Äî it's like English _What does X do?_ or _What is X?_ (remember, Lojban doesn't force you to distinguish between being and doing!)

We can see **mo** as asking someone to describe the relationship between the nouns in the question.

> **‚Äî do mo**
> _‚Äî How do you do? What's up?_
> `‚Äî You are what, you do what?`

This is the most common way of asking _How do you do?_, _Howdy?_ in Lojban. Some possible answers:

> **‚Äî mi gleki**
> _‚Äî I'm happy._

gleki
: $x_1$ is happy

> **‚Äî mi kanro**
> _‚Äî I'm healthy._

<!-- -->

> **mi tatpi**
> _I'm tired._

<!-- -->

> **mi gunka**
> _I'm working._

Another way of asking _How do you do?_:

> **‚Äî do cinmo le ka mo**
> _‚Äî How do you feel (emotionally)?_

cinmo
: $x_1$ feels $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

Other examples:

> **ti mo**
> _What is this?_

<!-- -->

> **la .meilis. cu mo**
> _Who is Mei Li? / What is Mei Li? / What is Mei Li doing?_

Possible answers depending on context:

- **ninmu**: _She's a woman._
- **jungo**: _She's Chinese._
- **pulji**: _She's a police officer._
- **sanga**: _She's a singer_ or _She's singing._

> **do mo la .kevin.**
> _What are you to Kevin?_
> `You are what (you do what) to Kevin.`

The answer depends on the context. Possible answers to this question are:

- **nelci**: _I like him._
- **pendo**: _I am his friend_
- **prami**: _I adore/am in love with him._
- **xebni**: _I hate him._
- **fengu**: _I'm angry with him._
- **cinba**: _I kissed him._

Note once again that the time is not important here: just as **cinba** can mean _kiss_, _kissed_, _will kiss_ and so on, **mo** does not ask a question about any particular time.

To differentiate between _to do_ and _to be someone or something_ we use additional verbs with **ma**:

> **la meilis cu zukte ma**
> `Mei Li does what?`

> **la meilis cu zukte le ka lumci**
> _Mei Li is does cleaning._

zukte
: $x_1$ does $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

lumci
: to clean (something)

> **do du ma**
> `You are who?`

> **mi du le ctuca**
> _I am the teacher._

Using modal terms with **ma** can give us other useful questions:

**pe ma** is attached only to nouns:

> **le penbi pe ma cu zvati le jubme**
> _Whose pen is on the table?_

### Number questions

> **le xo prenu cu klama ti**
> _How many people are coming here?_

<!-- -->

> **mu**
> _Five._

The word **xo** means _How many?_ and thus asks for a number. The full answer will be:

> **le mu prenu cu klama ti**
> _The 5 people are coming to this place._

So the person being asked is supposed to put an appropriate value in place of **xo**.

A few more examples:

> **le xo botpi cu kunti**
> _How many bottles are empty?_

<!-- -->

> **do ralte le xo gerku**
> _How many dogs do you keep?_

### Verbs of facts

Consider the example:

> **mi djuno le du'u do stati**
> _I know that you are smart._

djuno
: $x_1$ knows $x_2$ (proposition) about $x_3$


> **mi jimpe le du'u do pu citka**
> _I understand that you were eating._

jimpe
: $x_1$ understands $x_2$ (proposition) about $x_3$

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/na_jimpe.svg" caption="mi na jimpe" definition="I don't understand."></pixra>

In places that describe facts the particle **du'u** is used (instead of **nu**).

**djuno** (_to know_) and **jimpe** (_to understand_) describe facts. It'd be stupid to say _I understand that you were eating but in fact you weren't._

Note that the relation started with **du'u** doesn't have to be true:

> **le du'u do mlatu cu jitfa**
> _That you are a cat is false._

jitfa
: $x_1$ (proposition) is false

Where to use **du'u** and where to use **nu**? You may look into the dictionary:

- The label _(du'u)_ or _(proposition)_ marks places where **du'u** is recommended.
- The label _(nu)_ or _(event)_ marks places where **nu** is recommended.

If by mistake you use **nu** instead of **du'u** you will still be understood. But usually people speaking fluent Lojban distinguish these particles.

### Indirect questions

> **mi djuno le du'u ma kau tadni la .lojban.**
> _I know who is studying Lojban._

This is called an indirect question. The word _who_ here is not a request for information, there's no question mark. The answer is presumed. In fact you yourself know the answer to the question _Who is learning Lojban?_

**kau** is an interjection that we put after a question word telling that its an indirect question.

If I ask you the question **ma tadni la .lojban.**, you know what value to fill in the **ma** slot with: **la .kevin.** So you could just say

> **ma tadni la .lojban.**
> _Who is studying Lojban?_

<!-- -->

> **mi djuno le du'u ma kau tadni la .lojban.**
> _I know who is studying Lojban. I know the identity of the person studying Lojban._

<!-- -->

> **mi djica le nu ma tadni la .lojban.**
> _Who do I want to study Lojban?_
> `I want who to study Lojban?`

This can never be an indirect question: it is asking for an answer (even if you're doing it rhetorically).

You can put it after other question words:

> **mi djuno le du'u le xo kau prenu cu tadni la .lojban.**
> _I know how many people study Lojban._

### Indirect quotations (reported speech)

A relation like _Alice said "Michelle said ‚ÄúHello‚Äù to me"_ can also be expressed in a rather more subtle way:

> **la .alis. pu cusku zo'e pe le nu la .micel. pu rinsa le ninmu**
> _Alice said something about Michelle greeting her before._
> `Alice said something about the event of Michelle greeted her.`

or a bit shorter:

> **la .alis. pu cusku le se du'u la .micel. pu rinsa le ninmu**
> _Alice said that Michelle had greeted her._

The combination **se du'u** allows expressing indirect speech.

Here are the examples of verbs related to talking when using reported speech:

> **le ninmu pu retsku le se du'u mi klama ma kau**
> _She asked where I was going._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu spusku le se du'u mi klama le zdani**
> _I replied that I was going home._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu spuda le se retsku be le ninmu le ka spusku le se du'u mi klama le zdani**
> _I replied to her question by saying in reply that I was going home._

Questions in reported speech:

> **mi pu cusku le se du'u ma tadni la .lojban.**
> _Who did I say is studying Lojban?_
> `I said who is studying Lojban?`

Thus, Lojban has several words for _that ‚Ä¶_, depending on what sort of thing is meant.

- If _that_ describes what can be seen, heard, what happens, use **nu**.
- If _that_ describes what you think, some fact or information, use **du'u**.
- If _that_ describes what you say, use **se du'u**.
  - But if you need a literal quote use **lu ‚Ä¶ li'u**.

### Emotional interjections

We know such interjection as **.a'o** (_I hope_). There are interjections expressing other emotional states. They are similar to smileys like ;-) or :-( but in Lojban we can be more specific about our emotions still remaining concise in our speech.

Here are examples of widely used emotional interjections:


> **do jinga ui**
> _You won! (I'm happy about that!)_

ui
: interjection: _Yay!_, interjection of happiness

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/ui_jinga.svg" caption="ui mi jinga" definition="Yay! I won!"></pixra>

Interjections work like **sei** with their relations. **ui** means the same as **sei mi gleki** so we could as well say **do jinga sei mi gleki** meaning the same (although it's a bit more lengthy).

> **ie tu mlatu**
> _Yes, that is a cat._

<!-- -->

> **ie nai .i tu na ku mlatu**
> _No, I don't agree. That is not a cat._

ie
: interjection: _Yeah! Aye!_ (agreement)

ie nai
: interjection: disagreement

> **.ai mi vitke do**
> _I'm going to visit you._

.ai
: interjection: _I'm going to ‚Ä¶_ (intent)

> **.au do kanro**
> _I wish you were healthy._

.au
: interjection of desire

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/clira.svg" caption="mi clira klama" definition="I came early."></pixra>

> **.a'o do clira klama**
> _I hope you come early._

.a'o
: interjection: I hope

clira
: $x_1$ happens early

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/ciska.svg" caption=".ei mi ciska le xatra ti voi pelji ku'o le penbi" definition="I should write the letter on this paper using the pen."></pixra>

> **.ei mi ciska le xatra le pelji le penbi**
> _I should write the letter on the paper using the pen._

.ei
: I should ‚Ä¶ (obligation)

ciska
: $x_1$ writes $x_2$ on medium $x_4$

> **i'e do pu gunka le vajni**
> _Very good! You did an important work._

i'e
: interjection: _Fine!_ (approval)

> **.o'u tu mlatu**
> _Oh, that's only a cat._

.o'u
: interjection: _Phew!_ (relaxation)

In this case you probably thought that was something dangerous but it's only a cat so you are saying **.o'u**.

> **.u'i ti zmiku**
> _Ha-ha, this is a robot._

.u'i
: interjection: _Ha-ha!_ (amusement)

You can add or remove interjections to/from a sentence without the risk of breaking it.

Any word that starts with a pure vowel (excluding **u** and **i** before vowels) is prefixed with a dot in Lojban in writing and with a pause in speech. So the correct spelling is **.a'o** and so on. It's common to omit dots. We will do this later in this course for brevity. However, while speaking you should always show this dot by making a short pause before saying such word to prevent merging two neighboring words together into one.

Like with **xu** or **sei**\-relations we can add interjections after any noun, pronoun or verb thus expressing our attitude towards that part of the sentence.

### Urging interjections

A special group of interjections (in English called "imperative/hortative" interjections) make instigations, commands, requests, among which we already know **.e'o**:

> **.e'o mi ciksi da poi mi cusku djica**
> _Please, let me explain what I want to say._

.e'o
: interjection: _Please ‚Ä¶_ (request)

> **‚Äî au mi klama le nenri**
> **‚Äî .e'a**
> _‚Äî I'd like to enter._
> _‚Äî Please do._

.e'a
: interjection: _I allow, you may ‚Ä¶_ (permission)

le nenri
: the interior, what is inside

> **.e'ei do zukte**
> _C'mon, do it!_

.e'ei
: interjection: _Come on!_ (encourgament, instigation, provokation). Unofficial word

> **.e'i do zutse doi le verba**
> _Sit down, child!_

.e'i
: interjection: _Do that!_ (command)

> **.e'u do pinxe le jisra**
> _I suggest that you drink the juice. You'd better drink the juice._

.e'u
: interjection: _Let's ‚Ä¶_ (suggestion)

### ¬´**ko**¬ª for quicker urges

> **do bajra**
> _You run._

<!-- -->

> **bajra**
> _Someone runs._

In English the verb itself is a command:

> _Run!_

In Lojban **bajra** as a sentence means _Someone runs_ (or _is running_ / _was running_ and so on depending on context). **bajra** can also mean a command _Do run!_ but sometimes context isn't enough to make you decide whether it's an urge to run or simply a statement of the fact that someone runs or is running.

The pronoun **ko** is used instead of **do** to make requests, suggestions, commands.

> **ko bajra**
> _Run! Do run! Do it so that you run!_

**ko** is simply a more vague alternative to **do .e'o**, **do .e'u**, **do .e'i**.

It's perfectly fine to say a more precise

> **do .e'o bajra**
> _You, please run!_

putting the emphasis in our politeness onto **do** (_you_).

Moving **ko** in a relation moves command/request to that part, for example:

> **nelci ko**
> _Make it so you are liked by someone!_

nelci
: ‚Ä¶ likes ‚Ä¶ (something or someone)

As you can see we have to restructure this relation in English which still sounds weird, but you could use it in Lojban in the sense of _Try to make a good impression._

Note that **prami** corresponds to English _to love_ while **nelci** corresponds to English _to like_.

We can even have several **ko** in one sentence:

> **ko kurji ko**
> _Take care of yourself._

kurji
: ‚Ä¶ takes care of ‚Ä¶ (someone or something)

### Discursive interjections

> **au mi citka le salta .e ji'a le grute**
> _I'd like to eat the salad and the fruits too._

ji'a
: _additionally, also_, means that there exist others who also are the same (_you_ in this case) or who do the same

salta
: ... is some salad

grute
: ... is a fruit

> **mi si'a nelci do**
> `I too like you`

<!-- -->
> **‚Äî mi nelci le'e mlatu**
> **‚Äî mi si'a nelci le'e mlatu**
> _‚Äî I like cats._
> _‚Äî I like cats too (Me too)._

si'a
: _similarly, too_, denotes that something is similar while being different in other unmentioned aspects

### Structure of interjections: ¬´**nai**¬ª, ¬´**sai**¬ª, ¬´**pei**¬ª, ¬´**dai**¬ª

Interjection can consist of

1. the root like **ui** (_Yay!_)
2. then suffixes like **pei**, **dai**, **zo'o**:

    > **ui zo'o**
    > _Yay! (kidding, I'm not actually happy)_

3. both the root and each of the suffixes can be modified with scalar particles like **nai**:

    > **ui nai**
    > _Alas!_

    <!-- -->
    > **ui nai zo'o**
    > _Alas! (kidding, I'm not serious in this feeling)_

    <!-- -->
    > **ui nai zo'o nai**
    > _Alas, I'm not kidding, I feel unhappy_

Some examples of how scalar particles work.

- **ju'o** = _interjection: I'm sure (certaintty)_
- **ju'o cu'i** = _interjection: maybe, perhaps (uncertainty)_
- **ju'o nai** = _interjection: I have no idea!_

Common examples of interjections:

- interjection with bare root:

 > **ju'o le bruna co'i klama**
 > _I'm sure, the brother has come._

- scalar particle **cu'i** turns bare interjection into the middle attitude:

 > **ju'o cu'i le bruna co'i klama**
 > _Maybe the brother has come, I'm not sure._

- scalar particle **nai** turns interjection into the opposite attitude:

 > **ju'o nai le bruna co'i klama**
 > _Maybe the brother has come, maybe not, I have no idea_

 Similarly, **ui** is _Whee! Yay!_ while **ui nai** means _Alas!_

 Precise meanings of interjections that are meaningful with their scalar particles **cu'i** and **nai** are given in the dictionary.

- scalar particle **sai** denotes strong intensity of interjection:

 > **.u'i sai**
 > _Ha-ha-ha!_

Vocatives too can be modified with scalar particles:

> **ki'e sai do**
> _Thank you a lot!_

Suffixes are added after the root of interjection (together with its scalar particles if we used them):

- interjection suffix **pei** turns interjection into a question.

 > **‚Äî .au pei do .e mi klama le zarci**
 > **‚Äî .au cu'i**
 > _‚Äî Do you want that you and I go to the store?_
 > _‚Äî Meh, I don't have any preferences._

 <!-- -->

 > **‚Äî ie pei tu melbi**
 > **‚Äî ie**
 > _‚Äî That one is pretty, isn't it?_
 > _‚Äî Yeah._

- interjection suffix **dai** shows another's feelings, not feelings of the speaker:

 > **ui nai dai do na ku co'i jinga**
 > _You must be sad, you haven't won._

 <!-- -->

 > **.a'u**
 > _That's interesting!_

 <!-- -->

 > **.a'u dai**
 > _That must have been interesting for you!_

- Bare interjections express the attitude of the speaker. **ei do cliva** means not _You ought to leave_, but _I feel the obligation for you to leave_. **dai** shows that the speaker is empathizing someone else's feelings.

 > **.ei dai do cliva**
 > _You feel the obligation for yourself to leave._

Note that interjections don't necessarily show attitude towards the speakers themselves. Instead, they express speakers' attitude towards other things.

- interjection suffix **zo'o** marks the attitude as expressed not seriously:

 > **.e'u zo'o do pinxe ti**
 > _I suggest that you drink it (kidding)._

 **zo'o** is used just like the smiley-face in e-mail, to indicate that you're being humorous when saying something, and it's used for much the same reason. Although, simleys can be ambiguous, and **zo'o** has only one meaning, which is handy.

- Suffixes can also be modified with scalar particles:

 > **ie zo'o nai**
 > _I agree (not kidding)._

- **zo'o nai** is used to show that the information is not a joke:

  > **zo'o nai ra pu klama la .paris.**
  > _‚Äî I'm serious, he went to Paris._

- Suffixes can be used on its own:

  - **pei** when used alone asks for any interjection that the listener would feel appropriate:

  > **‚Äî pei le lunra cu crino**
  > **‚Äî .ie nai**
  > _‚Äî The moon is green (what is your feeling about it?)_
  > _‚Äî I disagree._

- For other suffixes they mean that the root interjection **ju'a** (_I state_) was omitted:

 > **zo'o do kusru**
 > **ju'a zo'o do kusru**
 > _You are cruel (kidding)._

 ju'a
 : interjection: I state (don't confuse it with **ju'o** (I'm sure))

Note how an emotion changes to its opposite with **nai** and to the middle emotion using **cu'i**.

Why are some cells of interjections with **cu'i** and **nai** empty? Because English lacks concise ways of expressing such emotions.

What is more, most of such interjections are used quite seldom.

These tables might help you understand their design.

### Combining interjections

> **iu ui nai**
> _I am unhappily in love._

<!-- -->

> **ue ui do jinga**
> _Oh, you won! I'm so happy!_

jinga
: ‚Ä¶ wins

In this case the victory was unprobable, I'm surprised and happy at the same time.

Interjections (unlike scalar particles and interjection suffixes) don't modify each other:

> **ue ui do jinga**
> **ui ue do jinga**
> _Oh, you won! I'm so happy!_

Here two interjections modify the same construct (the whole sentence) but they don't modify each other so their order is not important.

> **pei .u'i le gerku cu sutra plipe**
> _(What do you feel?) Heh, the dog is quickly jumping._

Here **pei** is used alone and doesn't modify **.u'i** which is put after it.

### Forgot to put an interjection at the beginning?

> **do pu sidju mi ui**
> _You help me (yay!)_

**ui** modifies only the pronoun **mi** putting the attitude only to _me_.

> **ui do pu sidju mi**
> _Yay, you helped me._

What if we forgot to add **ui** at the beginning of this relation?

We can explicitly label the relation as complete with **vau** and then put the interjection:

> **do pu sidju mi vau ui**
> _You helped me, yay!_

## Lesson 4. Practice

Now we know most crucial parts of the grammar and can start accumulating new words through situations.

### Colloquial expressions

sei
: comment starts

pacna
: to hope (for some event)

> **mi jimpe**
> _I understand._

ju'i
: vocative that draws attention: _Hey! Psst! Ahem! Attention!_

> **re'i**
> _Listening._

re'i
: vocative: _I'm ready to receive information._

> **xu do viska ta**

In English we say _–°an you see_, in Lojban we say just **xu do viska** ‚Äî _You see?_

<!-- -->

In this dialogue, the most important verbs for human senses were used. Here are their place structures, along with additional verbs and examples.

#### Vision

viska
: $x_1$ sees $x_2$ (object, form, color)

skari
: $x_1$ is an object with the color $x_2$ (property)

tarmi
: $x_1$ is the form of $x_2$

cukla
: $x_1$ is round (in form)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/coha_viska.svg" caption="le prenu co'a viska le cipni" definition="The person notices, begins to see the bird."></pixra>

> **mi viska le plise**
> _I see the apple._

> **mi viska le tarmi be le plise**
> _I see the form of the apple._

> **.i le plise cu se tarmi le cukla**
> _The apple is round._


<!-- -->
<!-- > **mi viska le se skari be le plise**
> _I see the color of the apple._ -->

> **.i le plise cu skari le ka xunre**
> _The apple is colored red._

Note: we can both say _see the form of the apple_ and _see the apple_.

#### Hearing

tirna
: $x_1$ hears $x_2$ (object or sound)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_prenu_cu_tirna_lei_djacu.svg" caption="le prenu cu tirna lei djacu" definition="The person hears the waters."></pixra>

> **mi tirna le palta**
> _I hear the plate_

<!-- -->

> **mi tirna le sance be le palta poi ca'o porpi**
> _I hear the sound of a plate that is falling._

> **.i le palta cu se sance le cladu**
> _It sounds loud._


le palta
: the plate

cladu
: $x_1$ is loud

tolycladu
: $x_1$ is quite in sound

tonga
: $x_1$ is a tone of $x_2$

We can use **cladu** and similar words directly:

> **mi tirna le cladu**
> _I hear something loud._

<!-- -->

> **mi tirna le tolycladu**
> _I hear something quite in sound._

<!-- -->

> **mi tirna le tonga be le palta poi farlu**
> _I hear the tone of the plate falling down._

Similarly to vision, we can say _hear a sound_ and _hear something producing the sound_:

> **‚Äî ma sance gi'e se tirna do**
> _‚Äî What sound do you hear?_

> **‚Äî le zgike**
> _‚Äî The music._

<!-- -->

> **‚Äî do tirna le sance be ma**
> _‚Äî You hear a sound of what?_

> **‚Äî le plise poi co'i farlu**
> _‚Äî The apple that has fallen down._

#### Perception in general

We can also use the vague **ganse** ‚Äî _to sense stimulus_.

ganse
: $x_1$ senses stimulus $x_2$ (object, event) by means $x_3$

ganse le glare
: to feel the heat

ganse le lenku
: to feel the cold

> **mi ganse le plise**
> _I sense the apple._

<!-- -->

For observing our perceptions we can use **zgana**:

> **mi zgana le tarmi be le plise**
> _I observe the form of an apple._

> **.i le plise cu se tarmi le'e cukla**
> _The apple is round._

zgana
: $x_1$ notices, observes, watches $x_2$. Not limited to vision

Some words can be used with different sensory verbs. For example, we can

viska le sefta
: to see the surface

zgana le sefta
: to palpate the surface

#### Sense of smell

sumne
: $x_1$ smells $x_2$ (odor)

panci
: $x_1$ is an odor of $x_2$ (object)

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/sumne.svg" caption="le mlatu cu sumne le xrula" definition="The cat smells the flower."></pixra>

> **mi sumne le xrula**
> _I smell the flower._


<!-- -->

> **mi sumne le panci be le za'u xrula**
> _I smell the odor of flowers._

<!-- -->

> **mi sumne le panci be le plise**
> _I smell the odor of the apple._

> **.i le plise cu se panci le xrula**
> _The apple smells of flowers._

Note that English confuses smelling an odor and smelling an object that produces that odor. We say _to smell the apple_, _the apple smells of flowers (has the scent of flowers)_. This two-fold distinction is important because an apple produces aromatic particles that are distinct from the apple itself. The same for a falling plate and its sound ‚Äî we may not want to mix them.

In Lojban we can easily separate between those cases like shown in the examples above.

#### Sense of taste

vrusi
: $x_1$ is a taste of $x_2$

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/zgana_le_vrusi.svg" caption="le prenu cu zgana le vrusi be le grute" definition="The person tastes, observes the taste of the fruit."></pixra>

> **mi zgana le vrusi be le grute**
> _I taste the apple._
> `I observe the taste of the fruit`

le grute
: the fruit, the fruits
<!-- -->

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/se_vrusi_lo_ka_kukte.svg" caption="le grute cu se vrusi le titla" definition="The fruits are sweet."></pixra>

> **.i le plise cu se vrusi le titla**
> _The apple tastes sweet._

titla
: ‚Ä¶ is sweet, ‚Ä¶ is a sweetie

#### Sense of touch

sefta
: $x_1$ is a surface of $x_2$

> **mi zgana le sefta be le plise**
> _I palpate, touch-feel the surface of the apple._

<!-- -->

> **.i le plise cu se sefta le xutla**
> _The apple has a smooth surface._

#### Pain

> **mi cortu le birka be mi**
> _I feel pain in my arm._
> _My arm hurts._

<!-- -->

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/cortu.svg" caption="mi cortu le cidni be mi" definition="My knee hurts."></pixra>

> **mi cortu le cidni**
> _I feel pain in my knee, my knee hurts._

cortu
: $x_1$ feels pain in $x_2$ (organ, part of $x_1$'s body)

cidni
: $x_1$ is a knee of $x_2$

#### Colors

Different language use different sets of words to denote colors. Some languages just refer to the color by referencing other "prototype" objects with similar color (or shade, form ‚Ä¶) In Lojban we use all the options:

> **ti xunre**
> _This is red._

xunre
: $x_1$ is red

> **ti skari le ka xunre**
> _This is red. This has the color or red things._

<!-- -->

> **ti skari le ka ciblu**
> _This has the color of blood._

le ciblu
: the blood

Below are some examples with colors that follow those of English language. Other verbs for colors can be used, they would reflect how people speaking other languages are used to classify things.

> **le tsani cu xunre ca le cerni**
> _The sky is red in the morning._


le tsani
: the sky

> **.i le solri cu simlu le ka narju**
> _The sun seems to be orange._

le solri
: the Sun

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/tsani.svg" caption="tsani .i solri" definition="The sky. The sun."></pixra>

simlu
: $x_1$ looks like $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

> **.i le pelxu xrula cu se farna le solri**
> _Yellow flowers are oriented towards the Sun._

se farna
: $x_1$ is oriented towards $x_2$

farna
: $x_1$ is the direction of $x_2$

> **.i le pezli be le tricu cu crino**
> _Leaves of trees are green._

pezli
: $x_1$ is a leaf of $x_2$

le tricu
: tree

> **.i mi zvati le korbi be le blanu xamsi**
> _I am at the border of a blue sea._

zvati
: ‚Ä¶ is present at ‚Ä¶

korbi
: $x_1$ is the border of $x_2$

le xamsi
: sea

> **.i mi catlu le prenu noi dasni le zirpu taxfu**
> _I look at a person who wears the violet dress._

dasni
: $x_1$ wears $x_2$ (something)

xunre
: $x_1$ is red

narju
: $x_1$ is orange

pelxu
: $x_1$ is yellow

crino
: $x_1$ is green

blanu
: $x_1$ is blue

zirpu
: $x_1$ is violet

Other useful verbs:

> **le gusni be le manku pagbu pu na ku carmi**
> _The light illuminating dark areas was not intense._

<!-- -->

> **le gusni be fi le solri pu carmi**
> _The light from the Sun was intense._

gusni
: $x_1$ is a light illuminating $x_2$ from the light source $x_3$

carmi
: $x_1$ is intense, bright

manku
: $x_1$ is dark

### ¬´**sipna**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_to sleep_‚Äô, ¬´**sanji**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_to be aware_‚Äô

The following are examples that illustrate some basic aspects of the mind:

> **pu ku mi cikna gi'e ku'i na ganse le nu do klama**
> _I was awake but didn't sense your arrival._

<!-- -->

> **pu ku ca le nu mi sipna kei mi ganse ku'i le nu do klama**
> _While I was asleep I nevertheless sensed you coming._

<!-- -->

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_prenu_cu_senva_tuha_le_nei.svg" caption="mi ca'o sipna gi'e sanji le nu mi sipna" definition="I sleep and I'm aware that I sleep."></pixra>

> **pu ku mi ca'o sipna gi'e sanji le nu mi sipna**
> _I was sleeping and I was aware that I was sleeping._
> _I was having a lucid dream._

<!-- -->

> **mi sanji le nu mi sanji**
> _I am aware that I'm aware._
> _I am self-conscious._

sipna
: $x_1$ sleeps

cikna
: $x_1$ is awake

ganse
: observer $x_1$ senses, notices some stimulus (event) by mrans $x_3$

sanji
: $x_1$ is conscious, aware of $x_2$ (event)

**ganse** doesn't imply any mental processing; it just describes perception, recognition, detection of some stimulus via sensory channels (specified in $x_3$).

On the other hand, **sanji** describes passive sensing which involves mental processing but not necessarily via sensory inputs at all (some mental relationships are not detected by the senses).

### Emotions: ¬´**cmila**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_to laugh_‚Äô, ¬´**cisma**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_to smile_‚Äô

> **coi**
> **.i ma nuzba**
> **.i do simlu le ka badri**
> _Hi._
> _What are the news?_
> _You seem to be sad._

badri
: $x_1$ is sad about $x_2$

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/badri.svg" caption="le prenu cu simlu lo ka badri" definition="The person seems to be sad."></pixra>

> **mi steba le nu le bruna be mi co'a speni le ninmu**
> _I am frustrated that my brother gets married a woman._

steba
: $x_1$ feels frustration about $x_2$

> **mi se cfipu**
> **.i xu do na ku gleki le nu le bruna co'a speni**
> _I am confused._
> _You are not happy that the brother gets married?_

### Health

> **ca glare**
> _It's hot now._

<!-- -->

> **.i ku'i mi ganse le lenku**
> _But I feel cold._

ku'i
: interjection: but, however

> **xu do bilma**
> _Are you ill?_

<!-- -->

> **bilma**
> _Yes._

<!-- -->

> **xu do bilma fi le vidru**
> **.i .e'u do klama le mikce**
> _Do you have a virus? I suggest you go to a doctor._

le vidru
: the virus

le mikce
: doctor

> **mi bilma le ka cortu le galxe**
> **.i mi sruma le du'u mi bilma fi la .zukam.**
> _My symptoms is that my throat aches._
> _I assume that I have a cold._

cortu
: $x_1$ has pain in $x_2$ (organ, part of $x_1$'s body)

la .zukam.
: common cold (disease)

> **ko kanro**
> _Get well!_

kanro
: $x_1$ is healthy

> **ki'e**
> _Thanks._

bilma
: $x_1$ is ill or sick with symptoms $x_2$ from disease $x_3$

Note that the second place of **bilma** describes symptoms like **le ka cortu le galxe** = _to have pain in the throat_

The third place is the name of the disease leading to those symptoms: Obviously, you may fill any place of **bilma**.

### Human body

> **le nanmu cu se xadni le clani**
> _The man has a long body. The man is tall._

se xadni

> **.i ku'i le pritu xance na ku cortu**
> _I hit something with the head and the left hand. Now the finger of the hand hurts. But the right hand doesn't hurt._

darxi
: $x_1$ hits $x_2$ with $x_3$

Most of words for parts of body have the same place structure as **xadni**:

stedu
: $x_1$ is a head of $x_2$

However, some describe smaller parts:

degji
: $x_1$ is a finger/toe on part $x_2$ (hand, foot)

> **le degji be le xance be le ninmu cu clani**
> _The woman's fingers are long._
> `Digits of hand of the woman are long`

> **mi viska le jamfu .i ku'i mi na ku viska le degji be le jamfu**
> _I can see the feet. But I don't see its toes._

janco

ctebi
: $x_1$ is a lip of mouth, orifice $x_2$

cidni
: $x_1$ is a knee or elbow of limb $x_2$

<!-- -->

> **ue**
> **.i le lanzu be do cu barda**
> _Wow!_
> _Your family is large._

<!-- -->

> **je'u pei**
> _Really?_

je'u
: interjection: truly

The verbs for names of family members have a similar place structure:

speni
: $x_1$ is a husband/wife of $x_2$

**co'a speni** means _to get married_:

> **mi co'a speni la .suzan.**
> _I married Susan._

lanzu
: $x_1$ is a family including $x_2$

panzi
: $x_1$ is a child of $x_2$

tixnu
: $x_1$ is a daughter of $x_2$

bersa
: $x_1$ is a son of $x_2$

tunba
: $x_1$ is a sibling (brother/sister) of $x_2$

bruna
: $x_1$ is a brother of $x_2$

mensi
: $x_1$ is a sister of $x_2$

Note that **panzi** can be applied to grown-up children of someone

verba
: $x_1$ is a child, immature person of age $x_2$ (event)

panzi
: $x_1$ is a child, offspring of $x_2$

**verba** doesn't necessarily talk of it as of a family member:

> **le bersa be le pendo be mi cu verba le nanca be li ci**
> _The son of my friend is a child of three years old._

citno
: $x_1$ is young

laldo
: $x_1$ is old, aged

Pairs of traditional words (for humans only):

le ninmu
: woman / women

le nanmu
: male man / male men

le nixli
: the girls

le nanla
: the boys

le remna
: the humans

Note that **le prenu** means _the people_, _the persons_. In fairy tales and fantastic stories not only humans (**le remna**) but animals or alien beings from other planets can be persons.

These words can be used for describing genetically determined sex (both in animals and humans) as opposed to gender:

le fetsi
: the female

le nakni
: male

These word describe parental (not necessarily genetic) relations:

mamta
: $x_1$ is a mother of $x_2$, $x_1$ acts maternally

patfu
: $x_1$ is a father of $x_2$

rirni
: $x_1$ is a parent of $x_2$, $x_1$ raises $x_2$

### In the shop

> **ue**
> **do pu te vecnu le laldo karce**

: comma between digits so that **pa ki'o** is _1, 000_ (_one thousand_)

vecnu
: $x_1$ sells $x_2$ to $x_3$

te vecnu
: $x_1$ buys $x_2$ from $x_3$

pleji
: $x_1$ pays $x_2$ to $x_3$ for $x_4$

zdani
: $x_1$ is a home of $x_2$

se zdani

## Lesson 5. Modal terms, ¬´**da**¬ª, their relative position

### How do modal terms refer to the relation?

- Some modal terms like those that describe time (tense) connect the current relation with the one in the noun after them:

> **mi cadzu ca le nu le cipni cu vofli**
> _I walk when the birds fly._

cadzu
: ‚Ä¶ walks

le cipni
: the bird/birds

vofli
: ‚Ä¶ flies to ‚Ä¶

> **mi pu cadzu fa'a le rirxe**
> _I walked towards the river._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu cadzu se ka'a le rirxe**
> _I walked to the river._

se ka'a
: coming to ‚Ä¶

fa'a
: directly towards ‚Ä¶

Modal terms don't remove ordered places (**fa**, **fe**, **fi**, **fo**, **fu**) from the relation:

> **mi klama se ka'a le rirxe le dinju**
> **mi klama fe le rirxe .e le dinju**
> _I go to a river, to a house._

Here, the first example uses **se ka'a** to connect **le rirxe** and then the second place of **klama** follows being filled with **le dinju**. It's the same as just filling the second place of **klama** two times, that is connecting them with **.e** ‚Äî _and_.

However, **se ka'a** is nice when applied to other verbs like **cadzu** in a previous example.

> **le prenu pu cadzu tai le nu ri bevri su'o da poi tilju**
> _The person walked as if he was carrying something heavy._

bevri
: $x_1$ carries $x_2$

tai
: modal term: like ‚Ä¶, resembling ‚Ä¶

<!--
- Some terms describe relations of the first place of the relation with the noun after the term:

>**mi jinga se rai le ka clani**
>_I win being the tallest one._

se rai
: term from **se traji**: being most in ‚Ä¶

Here $x_1$ of the relation corresponds to the most one in comparison specified after **se rai**.

- Finally, some terms describe relations of the first place of the relation and the relation itself with the noun after the term:

>**le fragari cu se nelci mi te rai le'i jbari**
>_Out of berries, I like strawberries most._

te rai
: term from **te traji**: preferring out of ‚Ä¶

lo fragari
: strawberries

lo jbari
: berries

$x_1$ of the relation describes the most one in this comparison, the relation itself describes the comparison.
-->

The dictionary explains such tricky cases where the relation defined by the term might pose difficulty. In practice, the relation is often clear from the examples provided.

### Using ¬´**ne**¬ª + term. ¬´**se mau**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_more than ‚Ä¶_‚Äô

> **mi ne se mau do cu melbi**
> _I am prettier than you._

se mau
: term from **se zmadu**: more than; the relation itself describes the comparison

This example is similar to

> **mi zmadu do le ka melbi**
> _I exceed you in prettiness._

In other words, the main relation **melbi** is similar to the third place of **zmadu**, which specifies the comparison criteria. Two more examples:

> **mi prami do ne se mau la .doris.**
> _I love you more than Doris._

<!-- -->

> **mi ne se mau la .doris. cu prami do**
> _I love you more than Doris does._
> _I love you more than Doris loves you._
> `I (more than Doris) love you.`

More examples:

> **mi nelci le'e pesxu ne se mau le'e jisra**
> _I like jam more than juice._

pesxu
: ‚Ä¶ is jam

> **le'e pesxu cu zmadu le'e jisra le ka mi nelci**
> _I like jam more than juice._
> `Jam exceeds juice in how much I like it.`

And now an interesting sentence:

> _Bob likes Betty more than Mary._

It can mean two different things in English!

1. Bob likes Betty and he likes Mary less.
2. Bob likes Betty but Mary likes Betty too, though not as much as Bob does!

Do we compare Betty with Mary in how Bob likes them?

Or instead we compare Bob with Mary in how they like Betty?

English is ambiguous in this regard.

However, **se mau** always compares the noun after it with the first place of the relation we know what we get:

> **la .bob. ne se mau la .maris. cu nelci la .betis.**
> **la .bob. cu nelci la .betis. se mau la .maris.**
> _Bob (compared to Mary) likes Betty more. Mary likes Betty less._

<!-- -->

> **la betis cu se nelci la bob se mau la maris**
> _Betty is loved by Bob more than Mary. Bob likes Mary less._

### Comparisons: ‚Äò_equal_‚Äô, ‚Äò_the same_‚Äô

> **mi dunli le mensi be mi le ka mitre .i ku'i mi na ku du le mensi**
> _I am as big as my sister. But I'm not her._
> `I equal the sister of me in meters. But i am not identical to the sister.`

dunli
: $x_1$ (any type) is equal to $x_2$ (any type) in $x_3$ (property of $x_1$ and $x_2$ with **kau**)

mitre
: $x_1$ is $x_2$ meters long

du
: $x_1$ (any type) is identical to $x_2$ (any type)

**dunli** compares two places for a single property, while **du** compares for identity. My sister and I are the same height, but we are not the same person. Clark Kent and Superman have different admirers, but they are the same person.

The same goes for another two verbs:

> **mi frica do le ka nelci ma kau**
> _We differ from each other in what we like._
> `I differ from you in liking what.`

<!-- -->

> **le drata be mi cu kakne le ka sidju**
> _Someone other than me is able to help._

frica
: $x_1$ (any type) differs from $x_2$ (any type) in $x_3$ (property of $x_1$ and $x_2$ with **kau**)

drata
: $x_1$ (any type) is not the same as $x_2$ (any type)

### The concept of ‚Äò_only_‚Äô

> **mi .e no le pendo be mi cu nelci le'e badna**
> _I and none of my friends like bananas._
> _Among my friends I'm the only one who likes bananas._

The concept of _not only_ is similarly expressed:

> **mi .e le su'o pendo be mi cu nelci le'e badna**
> _It's not just me who likes bananas among my friends._
> _I and some of my friends like bananas._

<!-- A more precise one:

> **mi se steci le ka nelci le'e badna kei le'i pendo be mi**
> _I'm the only one who likes bananas among my friends._ (by the way, implying that you are a friend to yourself)

se steci
: $x_1$ is the only one in $x_2$ (property of $x_1$) among $x_3$ (set) -->

<!-- Note that this example implies that you are a friend to yourself :) Otherwise, please, use an even more precise statement:

> **mi se steci le ka nelci le'e badna kei le'i me mi .e le pendo be mi**
> _I'm the only one who likes bananas among the set of me and my friends._ -->

<!-- Negating this we get:

> **na ku mi se steci le ka nelci le'e badna**
> _It's not true that only I like bananas._

‚Äî maybe no one likes bananas, maybe me + others lime them. -->

<!-- One more interesting example:

> **le'e troci cu se steci le ka snada**
> _Only the one who tries succeeds._
> `Who tries is the only one who succeeds.`

> **le'e po'o zukte be le ka troci cu fliba**
> _The only who only tries fails._
> `The one who does attempts and nothing but it fails.`

troci
: $x_1$ tries to do $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

snada
: $x_1$ succeeds in doing $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)
.
fliba
: $x_1$ fails in doing $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

And one more solution:

> **ro snada pu troci**
> _Everyone who succeeds tried._

ro
: number: each, every

As you can see, Lojban offers different methods of saying the same, some of which can significantly differ from English forms. -->

### ‚Äò_Most_‚Äô, ‚Äò_many_‚Äô and ‚Äò_too much_‚Äô

Words like _most_ and _many_ are also numbers in Lojban:

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>ro</b>
</td>
<td><i>each</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>so'a</b>
</td>
<td><i>almost all</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>so'e</b>
</td>
<td><i>most</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>so'i</b>
</td>
<td><i>many</i>, <i>a lot of</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>so'o</b>
</td>
<td><i>several</i>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>za'u</b>
</td>
<td><i>more than ‚Ä¶</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>du'e</b>
</td>
<td><i>too many</i>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Some examples:

> **su'e re no le prenu ba klama**
> _No more than 20 of the people will come._

<!-- -->

> **su'o pa le prenu cu prami do**
> _At least one person loves you._

### ‚Äò_never_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**no roi**¬ª, ‚Äò_always_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**ro roi**¬ª

Terms specifying the number of times:

- **no roi** = _never_
- **pa roi** = _once_
- **re roi** = _twice_
- **ci roi** = _thrice_

‚Ä¶

- **so'i roi** = _many times_
- **so'u roi** = _a few times_
- **du'e roi** = _too many times_
- **ro roi** = _always_

> **mi du'e roi klama le zarci**
> _I go to the market too often._

zarci
: $x_1$ is a market

> **mi pu re roi klama le zarci**
> _I went to the market twice._

Without **pu** the construct **re roi** may mean that once I went to the market but the second time I will be there only in the future. These time-related particles can be used with a noun after them:

> **mi klama ti pa roi le jeftu**
> _I come here once a week._

### ‚Äò_for the first time_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**pa re'u**¬ª, ‚Äò_for the last time_‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**ro re'u**¬ª

- **pa re'u** = _for the first time_
- **re re'u** = _for the second time_

‚Ä¶

- **za'u re'u** = _again_
- **ro re'u** = _for the last time_

The time-related particle **re'u** works like **roi** but tells the number of the iteration for which this event happens.

Compare:

> **mi pa roi klama le muzga**
> _I visited the museum once._

<!-- -->

> **mi pa re'u klama le muzga**
> _I visited the museum for the first time._

<!-- -->

> **mi za'u roi klama le muzga**
> _I visited the museum more times._

<!-- -->

> **mi za'u re'u klama le muzga**
> _I visited the museum again._

<!-- -->

> **mi za'u pa roi klama le muzga**
> _I visited the museum more than once._

<!-- -->

> **mi za'u pa re'u klama le muzga**
> _I visited the museum not for the first time (maybe for the second/third etc.))_

vitke
: to visit (somebody or something)

Note the difference between:

za'u re'u
: again, not for the first time

re re'u
: for the second time (same here, no context is needed, and even the exact number of times is given)

### Modal particles: their location within a relation

> **le nu tcidu kei ca cu nandu**
> _Reading is now difficult._

<!-- -->

> **ca ku le nu tcidu cu nandu**
> _Now reading is difficult._

Bare terms without arguments after them can be moved around the sentence by adding **ku** after them.

**ku** prevents the following nouns from attaching to such terms. Compare:

> **ca le nu tcidu cu nandu**
> _When reading it's difficult._

Here are several places where modal particles can go.

- modal term modifies the relation to the right of it:
  
 > **ca ku mi citka**
 > _Now I eat._

 ‚Äî the term is labelled with a word **ku** as being completed.

 > **ca le cabdei mi citka**

 > _Today I eat._

 ‚Äî the term with a noun after it as its argument.

 > **mi ca citka**

 > _I now eat._

 ‚Äî modal particle before the main relation construct and without a noun.

- Modal term is applied to the whole relation:

 > **mi citka ca**

 > _I eat now._

 ‚Äî modal term at the end of the relation.

### Joining statements with modals

> **mi pinxe le jisra ca le nu do co'i klama le zdani**
> _I am drinking the juice when you come home._

<!-- -->

> **mi pinxe le jisra .i ca bo do co'i klama le zdani**
> _I am drinking the juice, and at the same time you come home._

The two examples mean the same. The second option is mostly used when any of the original relations sound bulky.

Another use is to move modal terms out of scope of other modal terms:

> **mi na ku te vecnu ki'u le nu kargu**
> _It's not true that I buy because it's expensive._

So one might suppose that I only buy things if they are expensive. But no, I don't act thay way.

Here, **na ku** negates that _I buy things because they are expensive_. **na ku** is applied to the whole relation, thus it "covers" **ki'u**.

> **mi na ku te vecnu .i ki'u bo kargu**
> _I don't buy. It's because it's expensive._

Here, I don't buy things. Why? Because they are expensive. Maybe I prefer only cheap things.

Here, **ki'u** is placed to another sentence. Thus, **na ku** doesn't scope over it.

Both examples could be translated as _I don't buy because it's expensive._ However, they mean different things.

A special rule is for using **.i ba bo** and **.i pu bo**. Compare:

> **mi cadzu pu le nu mi citka**
> _I walk before I eat._

<!-- -->

> **mi cadzu .i ba bo mi citka**
> _I walk, and then I eat._

**.i ba bo** means _afterwards, then_. The sentence after **.i ba bo** refers to something that took place later than what took place in the relation before.

**pu** is changed into **ba**, and vice versa. This special rule for Lojban was made by analogy of natural languages. So you just have to remember this special behavior of these two words.

### Existing things, ‚Äò_there are ‚Ä¶_‚Äô

There are actually three words in **da** series: **da**, **de**, **di**. We use them if you need to refer to different objects in one discourse:

> **ci le mlatu cu citka re le finpe**
> _There are three cats, there are two fishes for each cat, and each cat eats two fishes._

If you need more such words in one discourse add a suffix **xi** to them and then any number (which we can call an index). Thus,

- **da xi pa** is the same as simple **da**,
- **da xi re** is the same as **de**,
- **da xi ci** is the same as **di**
- **da xi vo** is the fourth "something" and so on ‚Ä¶

### Topic and comment. ¬´**zo'u**¬ª

Sometimes it is useful to show the topic of a relation and then say a comment about it:

> **le'e finpe zo'u mi nelci le'e salmone**
> _As for fish I like salmon._

salmone
: ‚Ä¶ is a salmon

zo'u
: ends the topic and starts the comment of the relation

**zo'u** is more useful when a pronoun like **da** is defined in the topic and then used in the comment:

> **su'o da zo'u mi viska da**
> _There is a thing such that I see it._

<!-- -->

> **ro da poi gerku zo'u mi nelci da**
> _For each thing that is a dog: I like it._
> _I like all dogs._

<!-- -->

> **da de zo'u da viska de**
> _There is **da** and **de** such that **da** sees **de**._

The two pronouns **da** and **de** tell us that there are two things which stand in the relationship that one sees the other. It might be the case that the supposed two things are really just a single thing that loves itself: nothing in the sentence rules out that interpretation, which is why the colloquial translation does not say _Somebody sees somebody else._ The things referred to by different pronouns of **da** series may be different or the same.

It is perfectly okay for these pronouns to appear more than once in the same sentence:

> **da zo'u da prami da**
> _There is **da** such that **da** loves **da**.There is someone who loves himself/herself._

It is not necessary for a pronoun to be the direct noun of the relation:

> **da zo'u le gerku pe da cu viska mi**
> _There is **da** such that the dog of them sees me. Somebody's dog sees me._

### ‚Äò_any_‚Äô and ‚Äò_some_‚Äô in examples

The words _any_ and _some_ and their derivatives have many meanings in English. We should be careful to translate that intended meaning:

Translating as **da**:

- _some_: something unspecified:

 > **da pu klama .i je ko smadi le du'u da me ma kau**
 >_Somebody came. Guess who it was._

 <!-- -->

 > **mi pu tirna da .i je mi fliba le ka jimpe le du'u da mo kau**
 >_I heard something, but I fail to understand what it was._

- _some_ in questions turns into _anything_, _anybody_, in Lojban it's still **da**:

 > **xu su'o da pu klama**
 >_Did anybody come?_

- _some_ when using commands, request, suggestions:

 > **.e'u mi'o pilno su'o da poi drata**
 >_Let's try other things._

 <!-- -->

 > **.e'u mi'o troci bu'u su'o da poi drata**
 >_Let's try somewhere else._

- _any_ can be used in inner relations:

 > **mi rivbi le ka jdice da**
 >_I avoided taking any decision._

 like in relations inside modal terms:

 > **ba le nu do zgana da kei ko klama**
 >_After you notice anything, come!_

- Scope: _any_ is used in English when negating while Lojban uses **na ku** but then still **da**:

 > **mi na ku viska su'o da poi prenu**
 >_I don't see anybody._

- _any_ is used when making no distinction among members we talk about:

 > **.au nai mi tavla su'o da poi na ku slabu mi**
 >_I don't want to talk to just anybody._

- Scope: negation has to be used in an appropriate relation like here:

 > **mi jinvi le du'u na ku da jimpe**
 >_I don't think that anybody understands._

 This can be rephrased as:

 > **mi jinvi le du'u no da jimpe**
 >_I think that nobody understands._

- _every_ is turned into _any_ in comparisons and translated as **ro da**:

 > **do zmadu ro da le ka se canlu**
 >_You are taller than anybody._
 >`You exceed everybody in size.`

- _any_ is used when providing choice and translated as **ro da**:

 > **ro da poi do nelci zo'u .e'a do citka da**
 >_You may eat anything you like._
 >`For everything that you like I allow you to eat it.`

- _anyone_, _somewhere_:

 > **.e'u mi'o troci bu'u su'o da poi drata**
 >_Let's try somewhere else._

 Here, **su'o da poi drata** actually means _any other thing or things, place or places_. The number of such places is not specified although any such place might fit.

 What if we want to say _any place but only one place_?

 > **.e'u mi'o troci bu'u pa da poi drata**
 >_Let's try at another place._

Translating _any_ as **le'e** in generic statements:

> **le'e gerku cu se tuple le vo da**
>_Any dog has four legs. Dogs have four legs._

Using **le**. We use **le** when we describe specific objects, places, events:

> **le drata zo'u .e'u mi'o pilno ri**
>_The other thing, let's use it._

<!-- -->

> **le drata stuzi zo'u .e'u mi'o troci bu'u ri**
>_The other place, let's try there._

### Resume: which constructs does scope affect?

Scope is created only by:

- borders of relation,
- modals terms and modal particles of main relation construct,
- nouns starting with numbers (like **pa le prenu** ‚Äî _one of the persons_),
<!-- - discursive interjections **po'o**, **ji'a**. -->

**da**, **de**, **di** if used without a prenex and without an explicit number in front are meant to mean **su'o da**, **su'o de**, **su'o di** and thus also create scope.

Thus the relative order of such constructs changes the meaning:

> **pa le prenu ca ku zvati**
> _There is one person who is now present._

<!-- -->

> **ca ku pa le prenu ca zvati**
> _Now there is one person._

Scope isn't relevant for verbs and nouns starting with **le** (like **le prenu** or **le re prenu**). Both these sentences mean the same:

> **le prenu ca ku zvati le zdani**
> **ca ku le prenu cu zvati le zdani**
> **ca ku fe le zdani fa le prenu cu zvati**
> _People are now present._

Modal term scopes from where it's used to the right of the relation until the relation and all its inner relations (if present) end.

Here, **ki'u le nu kargu** is under the scope of **na ku**:

> **na ku mi te vecnu ki'u le nu kargu**
> _It's not true that: I buy because it's expensive._

But here, **ki'u le ne kargu** is not under the scope of **na ku**. **ki'u** is applied to the whole previous sentence including **na ku**:

> **mi na ku te vecnu .i ki'u bo kargu**
> _I don't buy. It's because it's expensive._

## Lesson 6. Modal terms: time and space

> **mi citka le cirla**

Possible translations:

> _I eat cheese._
> _I ate cheese._
> _I always eat cheese._
> _In a moment, I will have just finished eating cheese._

Tenses in Lojban are optional, we don't have to think all the time what tense to use.

Context often resolves what is correct. We add tenses when we feel we need them.

Lojban tenses treat time and space the same. Saying that _I worked a long time ago_ is not grammatically different than saying _I work far away to the north_. English treats words like _earlier_, past tense ending _\-ed_ and space words like _in_ or _near_ in three different schemes, while in Lojban they follow the same principle.

### Points in time and place

Modal particle without a noun after it describes the event as relative to _here_ and _now_:

> **mi pinxe ba**
> **mi ba pinxe**
> _I will drink._

<!-- -->

> **mi pinxe bu'u**
> **mi bu'u pinxe**
> _I drink at this place._

Modal term with a noun after it describes the event as relative to the event in that noun:

> **mi pinxe ba le nu mi cadzu**
> _I drink after I walk._

### Events relative to other events in time

In English we use the so called "sequence of tenses":

> **la .alis. pu cusku le se du'u ri pu penmi la .doris. la'u le djedi be li ci**
> _Alice told that she had seen Doris three days before._

Here, the event _had seen Doris_ happens before the event _Alice said_. However, in

> **la .alis. pu cusku le se du'u ri ca kansa la .doris.**
> _Alice told that she was with Doris._

the two events (_told_ and _was with Doris_) happen at the same time.

Thus in English

- the tense of the main relation is understood relative to whoever utters this relation.
- the tense of the relation inside the main relation is also understood relative to whoever utters this relation.

And in Lojban

- only the tense of the main relation is relative to whoever utters the relation.
- the other tenses are relative to each other. This is why, in **la .alis. pu cusku le se du'u ri pu penmi la .doris. la'u le djedi be li ci** the second **pu** is relative to the first **pu**. In **la .alis. pu cusku le se du'u ri ca kansa la .doris.**, we use **ca** (_at the same time_) which is relative to the outer relation (**pu cusku** ‚Äî _said_).

However, we can use the modal term **nau** (_at the time or place of the speaker_), which will give the same effect as how English works:

Here is an example in English style:

> **la .alis. pu cusku le se du'u ri nau pu kansa la .doris.**
> _Alis said that she was with Doris._

<!-- To say such phrases as `in three days` or `two years ago` we basically put time intervals in sequence without overlapping. Hence a new verb:

> **le cabna cu dzoli le nu mi penmi do kei li ci le ka prulamdei**
> _I will meet you in three days (as measured from now)._

> **dzoli le nu mi penmi do kei li ci le ka prulamdei**
> **dzoli le nu mi penmi do kei li ci le ka prulamdei**
> **prulamdeidzo le nu mi penmi do kei li ci**
> **mi penmi do fi'o prulamdeidzo be fi li ci**
> _I will meet you in three days._

> **le cabna cu dzoli le nu mi zvati le stuzi kei li re le ka bavlamdeidzo**
> **le nu mi zvati le stuzi kei le cabna cu dzoli li re le ka prulamdeidzo**
> _I visited that place two years ago._ -->

### Distance in time and space

fau
: modal term: at the same time, place or situation as ‚Ä¶

ca
: modal term: at ‚Ä¶ (some time), at the same time as ‚Ä¶; "present tense"

bu'u
: modal term: at ‚Ä¶ (some place); here (at this place)

zi
: _just_ (short time ago) or _soon_ (in a short time)

vi
: near ‚Ä¶

za
: _a while ago_ or _in a while, in an unspecified time_

va
: not far from ‚Ä¶

zu
: _long time ago_ or _in a long time_

vu
: far away from ‚Ä¶; far away

This is how we can use tense combinations specifying how far we ago into the past or future:

- **pu zu** means _a long time ago_
- **pu za** means _a while ago_
- **pu zi** means _just_
- **ba zi** means _soon_
- **ba za** means _in a while_
- **ba zu** means _in a long time_

Notice the vowel order **i**, **a** and **u**. This order appears again and again in Lojban, and might be worth to memorize. _Short_ and _long_ in are always context dependent, relative and subjective. Two hundred years is a short time for a species to evolve, but a long time to wait for the bus.

**zi**, **za** and **zu** modify the tense particle like **pu** and **ba** that is said before it:

- **pu zu** is _a long time ago_. **pu** shows that we begin in the past, **zu** then that it is a long time backwards.
- **zu pu** is _far away in time there is a point after some event_. **zu** shows that we begin at some point far away in time from now, **pu** then, that we move backwards from that point.

Thus **pu zu** is always in the past. **zu pu** could be in the future.

Spatial distance is marked in a similar way by **vi**, **va** and **vu** for short, unspecified (medium) and long distance in space.

To specify distance in time or space we use the modal term **la'u** with an argument specifying the distance:

> **ba ku la'u le djedi be li ci mi zvati ti**
> _In three days I will be here._

The space equivalent of **ca** is **bu'u**. And **fau** is more vague than two of them, it can mean time, space or situation.

> **ba za vu ku mi gunka**
> _Some time in the future, I will work a place long away._

gunka
: to work

> **mi bu'u pu zu gunka**
> _I used to work here a long time ago._
> `I here-past-long-time-distance work`

> **pu zu vu ku zasti fa le ninmu .e le nanmu**
> _Long ago and far away lived a woman and a man._

The last sentence is how fairy tales often begin.

### Duration in time and space

ze'i
: modal term: for a short time

ve'i
: modal term: over a small space

ze'a
: modal term: for some time

ve'a
: modal term: over some space

ze'u
: modal term: for a long time

ve'u
: modal term: over the long space

Again it's easy to remember given the pattern **i**, **a**, **u**.

> **mi ze'u bajra**
> _I run for a long time._

<!-- -->

> **la .bob. ze'u pinxe le birje**
> _Bob drinks beer for a long time._

<!-- -->

> **mi ba zi ze'a xabju la .djakartas.**
> _Pretty soon I'm going to live in Jakarta for a while._

<!-- -->

> **le jenmi pe la .romas. ba ze'u gunta la .kart.xadact.**
> _The army of Romans will be attacking Carthage for a long time._

This does not mean that Romans are not attacking Carthage these days. In Lojban, if we say that something is true at a particular time, it doesn't mean that it is not true at any other time. You can say **pu ba ze'u** so that we know that this activity was in future when viewed from some point in past but in past when viewed from today.

> **le xamsi**
> _sea/ocean_

<!-- -->

> **le ve'u xamsi**
> _ocean_

<!-- -->

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/le_vehi_ja_vehu_cmana.svg" caption="le ve'i cmana cu jibni le ve'u cmana" definition="The hill is near the mountain."></pixra>

> **le cmana**
> _mountain/hill_

<!-- -->

> **le ve'u cmana**
> _mountain_

> **le ve'i cmana**
> _hill_

<!-- -->

> **do ve'u klama le dotco gugde ze'u**
> _You spend a long time traveling a long space to Germany._

<!-- -->

> **ti ve'u gerku**
> _That's a big dog. This is a dog covering a large space._

### ¬´**pu'o**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_to be about_‚Äô, ¬´**ba'o**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_no longer_‚Äô, ¬´**za'o**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_still_‚Äô, ¬´**xa'o**¬ª ‚Äî ‚Äò_already_‚Äô

Here are several sets of modal terms that can help us add finer meanings when necessary.

With the _event contours_ and unlike **pu**, **ca** and **ba** we view each event as having shape with certain stages:

pu'o
: modal term: to be about to do something (the event has not yet happened)

ba'o
: modal term: to be no longer doing something, to have done something (the event has ended)

Examples:

> **mi ba tavla le mikce**
> _I will speak to the doctor (and I might be speaking now too)._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu pu'o tavla le mikce**
> _I was about to speak to the doctor (I was not speaking at that time, the event hadn't started by that time)._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/puho_nenri.svg" caption="le prenu pu'o zvati le nenri" definition="The person is about to be inside."></pixra>

<!-- -->

> **le sanmi ca pu'o bredi**
> _The meal is not ready yet._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu ba'o tavla le mikce**
> _I had spoken to the doctor._

<pixra url="/assets/pixra/cilre/baho_carvi.svg" caption="ba'o carvi" definition="Aftermath of the rain. The rain has stopped."></pixra>

<!-- -->

> **mi ba ba'o tavla le mikce**
> _I will have spoken to the doctor._

<!-- -->

> **.a'o mi ba zi ba'o gunka**
> _I hope soon I will have done the work._

za'o
: modal term: still. The event is in process beyond its natural end

xa'o
: unofficial modal term: already, too early. The event already started and it is too early

Examples:

> **ri'a ma do za'o zvati vi**
> _Why are you still here?_

<!-- -->

> **la .kevin. xa'o zvati vi**
> _Kevin is already here._

### Stages of event

> **mi co'a tavla**
> _I started talking._

<!-- -->

> **ra ca'o ciska**
> _She keeps writing._

<!-- -->

> **ra pu co'u vasxu**
> _He stopped breathing (sudden unpredictable change)._

vasxu
: $x_1$ breathes $x_2$

> **mi pu mo'u citka le plise**
> _I've eaten the apple up._

<!-- -->

> **la .maks. pu mo'u zbasu ti voi dinju**
> _Max has built this house._

<!-- -->

> **ra pu de'a vasxu**
> _She ceased to breath (but may breath again later)._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu di'a citka le plise**
> _I resumed eating apples._

co'a
: modal term: the event starts (the border of the event)

ca'o
: modal term: to be doing something (the event is in progress)

co'u
: modal term: the event stops

mo'u
: modal term: the event ends (the border of the event)

de'a
: the event pauses (the event can be expected to continue)

di'a
: the event resumes

> **mi de'a ze'i jundi**
> _BRB (I'll be right back)._

<!-- -->

> **mi di'a jundi**
> _I am back (being attentive)._

jundi
: $x_1$ pays attention to $x_2$

These two expressions are common in text chats for saying that you stop paying attention or away, and then back online:

One could of course also say just **de'a** or **di'a** and hope the point gets across.

### Continuous and progressive events

ru'i
: modal term: the event is continuous

> **.i mi pu ru'i citka le plise**
> _I was eating apples one and on without stop._

Note the difference:

- **ru'i** says that the event is continuous and never pauses.
- **ca'o** says that the event progresses. It may sometimes pause and then resume its progress.

### Place contours

Event contours can be used to refer to space if we prefix them with **fe'e**:

> **le rokci cu fe'e ro roi zvati**
> _The stones are everywhere._

### ‚Äò_to the left_‚Äô, ‚Äò_to the right_‚Äô

> **le prenu cu sanli le dertu bu'u le pritu be mi**
> _The person stands on the ground to the right of me._

<!-- -->

> **le gerku cu vreta le ckana bu'u le zunle be le verba**
> _The dog is lying on the bed to the left of a child._

<!-- -->

> **ko jgari le panbi poi zunle**
> _Take the pen on the left._

<!-- -->

> **le mlatu cu plipe bu'u le crane be do**
> _A cat jumps in front of you._

<!-- -->

> **ko catlu le dinju poi crane**
> _Look at the house in the front._

<!-- -->

> **le verba cu zutse le stizu bu'u le trixe be mi**
> _The child sits on the chair behind me._

<!-- -->

> **le prenu cu sanli ki mi bu'u le pritu be le tricu bei mi**
> _The person stands to the right of a tree from my viewpoint._

<!-- -->

> **le dinju cu zunle le rokci ti**
> _The house is to the left of the rock if viewed from here._

zunle
: $x_1$ is to the left of $x_2$ as viewed from $x_3$

pritu
: $x_1$ is to the right of $x_2$ as viewed from $x_3$

crane
: $x_1$ is in front of $x_2$ ($x_1$ is between $x_2$ and whoever watches) as viewed from $x_3$

trixe
: $x_1$ is behind $x_2$ as viewed from $x_3$

sanli
: $x_1$ stands on $x_2$

zutse
: $x_1$ sits on $x_2$

vreta
: $x_1$ lies on $x_2$

le dertu
: the ground, the dirt

le ckana
: the bed

le stizu
: the chair

le pelji
: the paper

le penbi
: the pen

## Lesson 7. Letters, referring to relations, dates

### Names of letters in Lojban

Each letter has a name in Lojban.

The following table represents the basic Lojban alphabet and how to pronounce letters (below each letter):

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>'

<td><b><font  class="guibutton" color="#FF1493">a</font></b>

<td><b>ty.</b>
</td>
<td><b>.u bu</b>
</td>
<td><b>vy.</b>
</td>
<td><b>xy.</b>
</td>
<td><b>.y bu</b>
</td>
<td><b>zy.</b>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

As you can see

- to get the name for a vowel, we add the word **bu**
- to get the name for a consonant, we add **y.** to the consonant
- the word for **'** (apostrophe) is **.y'y**.

We can spell word using these names. For example, CNN will be **cy. ny. ny.**

<!-- A capital letter alone has a special meaning. It denotes the name of that letter:

**A** is the same as **.abu**, **B** is the same as **by.** and so on. They means the same and even are read the same as normal **.abu**, **by.** etc. So _CNN_ can also be written as **CNN** in Lojban and it will be still pronounced and mean the same as **cy. ny. ny.** -->

### Letters instead of ‚Äò_he_‚Äô and ‚Äò_she_‚Äô

A string of one or more letter names works as a pronoun. And we can use them for another method of referring to nouns and names earlier used in speech.

> **la .alis. pu klama le nurma .i le nurma cu melbi la .alis.**
> **la .alis. pu klama le nurma .i ri melbi la .alis.**
> **la .alis. pu klama le nurma .i ny. melbi la .alis.**
> **la .alis. pu klama le nurma .i ny. melbi .a bu**
> _Alice went to the country. The rural area is beautiful to Alice._
> _Alice went to the country. It is beautiful to her._

All the Lojban variants mean the same.

As the first letter in **.alis.** is **a** (we ignore the dot) and the first letter in **nurma** is **n** we can use letter words to refer to those nouns correspondingly:

- **.a bu** refers to **la .alis.**
- **ny.** refers to **le nurma**

This method might be more convenient than English _he_ or _she_ or event Lojban **ri** or **ra**. This method allows us to make the speech more concise but at the same time precise not forcing us to repeat possible long names or nouns over and over again.

But notice that it can happen that we'd like to refer back to, say, **le nurma**, but then before we can do so, another noun or name that starts with **n** appeared in the meantime, so that **ny.** can no longer refer to the rural area. The quickest way out is to repeat the entire noun or name, i.e. say **le nurma**:

> **bu'u le nurma la .alis. pu penmi la .nik. i ri se zdani bu'u le nurma**
> _In the country Alice met Nick. He has his home in the country._

zdani
: ‚Ä¶ is a home to ‚Ä¶

se zdani
: ‚Ä¶ has a home ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ lives in ‚Ä¶

If a name consists of several cmevla you can use the first letters of them to refer to that name. The same is for compound verbs:

> **la .djan.smit. cu citka le glare stasu .i dy.sy. nelci fy.sy.**
> _John Smith is eating the hot soup. He likes it._

glare
: ‚Ä¶ is hot

**dy.sy.** is a single pronoun. Same for **fy.sy.**, of course.

If you need to put several pronouns one after another separate them with the word **boi**:

> **mi klama la .paris. la .moskov.**
> _I go to Paris from Moscow._

<!-- -->

> **mi klama py. boi my.**
> _I go to P from M._

The sentence **mi klama py. my.** would mean _I go to PM_ which wouldn't mean what is needed here.

> **la .tom.silver. pu zvati .i je'u ty. sy. boi .ui pu sidju mi**
> _Tom Silver was present. And actually TS (yay!) helped me._

If you put an interjection after such letters separate them with **boi**. Without **boi** interjections will refer to the last letter.

### ‚Äò_we_‚Äô ‚Äî different ways of saying that

In Lojban, there are several pronouns close in meaning to _we_.

mi'o
: you and I

mi'a
: we without you

ma'a
: you and I and another one/others

So when speaking you'd have to be a bit more careful which meaning of _we_ you need.

And finally:

mi
: I or the speakers

**mi** can also mean _we_! Lojban makes no distinction between singular and plural by default. So if several people are speaking all together, **mi** (which refers to the one or more speakers) is perfectly correct for _we_. In practice, you'll usually get **mi** used like that when one person is presuming to speak (or more often, to write) on behalf of others.

Some examples:

> **mi prami do**
> _I love you._

<!-- -->

> **mi'a ba penmi do**
> _We'll meet you._

<!-- -->

> **ma'a remna**
> _We are all human._

<!-- -->

> **mi djica le nu do cliva**
> _We want you to go away._

cliva
: $x_1$ leaves

### ¬´**ri**¬ª instead of ‚Äò_he_‚Äô and ‚Äò_she_‚Äô

Earlier we learned of the pronoun **ri**:

ri
: pronoun: refers to the previous noun or pronoun that just finished (skipping stable pronouns like **mi**, **do**, words for _we_)

> **mi catlu le nanmu .i ri melbi**
> _I look at a man. He is handsome._

melbi
: $x_1$ is beautiful / pretty / handsome to someone $x_2$

**ri** refers to the previous completed noun used in text or someone's speech:

> **la .alis. cu sipna bu'u le sledi'u pe la .alis.**
> _Alice sleeps in Alice's room._
> `Alice sleeps-in the of-Alice room.`

> **la .alis. cu sipna bu'u le kumfa pe ri**
> _Alice sleeps in her room._
> `Alice sleeps in the room of [previous noun].`

sledi'u
: $x_1$ is a room for purpose $x_2$ (proposition)

The **ri** is equivalent to repeating the last noun or name, which is **la .alis.** here.

One aspect to notice is that **ri** does not repeat **le kumfa pe ri** (which is also a noun), because **ri** is a part of that noun and therefore that noun is not "previous", not finished yet when **ri** appears. This prevents **ri** from making it recursively refer to itself.

Another example:

> **le du'u le prenu cu melbi cu se djuno ri**
> _That the person is pretty is known to herself._

The **ri** refers to **le prenu** (and not **le du'u le prenu cu melbi** although both nouns are complete: **le prenu** starts last, after the start of **le du'u le prenu cu melbi**.

Relation inside **sei** forms a parallel text. **ri** skips nouns inside **sei**\-relations:

> **mi viska la .lukas. sei la .doris. pu cusku .i ri jibni la .micel.**
> _I see Lucas, ‚Äî Doris said. He is near Michelle._

In this example **ri** cannot refer to **la .doris.** We simply skip the whole **sei la .doris. pu cusku** relation when deciding what **ri** should refer to.

Pronouns that are stable across the dialogue or story are ignored by **ri**. We just repeat them directly:

> **mi lumci mi**
> _I wash myself._
> `I wash me`

lumci
: $x_1$ washes $x_2$

> **mi prami mi**
> _I love myself._
> `I love me.`

However,

- the pronouns **ti**, **ta**, **tu** are picked up by **ri**, because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating **tu** may not be effective.
- likewise, **ri** itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later **ri**; in fact, a string of **ri** words with no other intervening nouns always repeat the same noun:

> **la .alis. cu catlu le nanmu .i ri melbi .i ri co'a zgana .a bu**
> _Alice notices a man. He is handsome. He notices Alice._

zgana
: to observe

co'a zgana
: to start observing, to notice

Here the second **ri** has as antecedent the first **ri**, which has as antecedent **le nanmu**. All three refer to the same thing: the man.

Only you decide what, where and when to use in speech: the method with **le**+verb words, the method with letter names or with **ri**.

<!-- ### "_Myself, themselves_"

In Slavic languages people say literally _I wash self_. In order to be closer to a Slavic style we can use **lo nei**.

>**mi nelci mi**
>_I like myself._

>`I like me.`

It is the same in meaning as:

>**mi nelci lo nei**
>_I like myself._

>**mi lumci mi**
>**mi lumci lo nei**
>_I wash myself._

>**la ian ca lumci lo nei**
>**la ian ca lumci ri**
>_Yan washes himself._

**lo nei** links to the first noun of the current relation.

Remember that **ri** can't refer back to pronouns like **mi** so **lo nei** might be preferred in the last example. When changing the first noun **lo nei** doesn't change which is quite handy:

>**mi lumci lo nei i do lumci lo nei i la ian cu lumci lo nei**
>_I wash myself. You wash yourself. Yan washes himself._

>**la .doris. cu pensi lo nei**
>_Doris thinks about herself._

>**pa gerku cu batci lo nei**
>_A dog bites itself._

---

**nei** works well when a sentence only contains one relation. But when it has several embedded relations we might need something different. In

>**la .doris. cu djuno lo du'u la .alis. cu prami lo nei**
>_Doris knows that Alice loves herself._

**lo nei** refers to **la .alis.**

What if we want to refer to Doris? Here is a solution:

>**la .doris. cu djuno lo du'u la .alis. cu prami vo'a**
>_Doris knows that Alice loves her._

So while **lo nei** refers to the first noun of the current relation, **vo'a** refers to the first noun of the current sentence.

When there are no embedded relations those two words mean the same:

>**la .alis. cu prami vo'a** is the same as **la .alis. cu prami lo nei**
>_Alice loves herself._

- **vo'a** refers to the first noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'e** refers to the second noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'i** refers to the third noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'o** refers to the 4th noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'u** refers to the 5th noun of the current sentence.

---

**lo nei** can give funny results when applied to mutual actions:

>**la .alis. e la .kevin. cu cinba lo nei**
>_Alice kisses herself, and Kevin kisses himself._

Here is the solution:

>**la .alis. jo'u la .kevin. cu cinba zu'ai**
>_Alice and Kevin kiss each other_

It means the same as:

>**la alis cu cinba la kevin i je la kevin cu cinba la alis**
>_Alice kisses Kevin, and Kevin kisses Alice._

**zu'ai** is put into the second place of the verb. It shows the mutual action between the first place and the second place. Members of this mutual action are put to the first and connected with the conjunction **jo'u**. -->

### ¬´**go'i**¬ª for the previous relation

> **la .alis. cu klama le barja .i la .alis. cu viska le nanmu**
> **la .alis. cu klama le barja .i le go'i cu viska le nanmu**
> _Alice comes to the bar. She sees a man._

**le go'i** refers to the first place of the previous relation.

**go'i** presents yet another way of referring back to a noun that we need.

- **le se go'i** refers to the second place of the previous relation
- **le te go'i** to the third etc.:

Examples:

> **.i la .alis. cu zgana le nanmu .i ri melbi**
> **.i la .alis. cu zgana le nanmu .i le se go'i cu melbi**
> _Alice watches a man. He is handsome._

Here, **le se go'i** refers to the second place ($x_2$) of the preceding relation, which is **le nanmu**.

Another example:

> _Bill saw Nick. He hit him._

English doesn't bother with precision here ‚Äî _he_ just means _some male person mentioned somewhere near in the text or deduced from context._ Did Bill hit Bob, or did Bob hit Bill? We don't know. In Lojban we can say:

> **la .bil. pu viska la .nik. .i le se go'i cu darxi le go'i**
> _Bill saw Nick. Nick hit Bill._

Although, in most cases **ri** or letter words can be used:

> **la .bil. cu viska la .nik. i ri darxi la .bil.**
> **la .bil. cu viska la .nik. i ny. darxi by.**
> _Bill saw Nick. Nick hit Bill._

**go'i** itself is a verb, and it thus has a place structure:

> **mi tatpi .i do ji'a go'i**
> _I'm tired. And you too._

When we say **do go'i**, we repeat the previous relation but replace its first place with **do**. In other words, **do ji'a go'i** here is the same as saying **do ji'a tatpi**.

<!-- ### What does **go'i** copy?

Interjections like **pei** (when used alone), **xu**, **.ui**, **.u'i**, **je'u** those formed with **sei** and the question interjection are not parts of relations. Thus they are not copied by **go'i**.

Terms like **na ku**, **pu**, left negators like **na'e**, **no'e**, **to'e** are parts of relations.

Thus, **go'i** copies the previous relation with those particles:

>‚Äî **la .bob. na ku prami la .alis.**
>‚Äî _**go'i**_

>‚Äî _It is not true that Bob loves Alice._

>‚Äî _ He doesn't (love)._

> **‚Äî la .bob. na'e prami la .alis.**
> _‚Äî Bob doesn't love Alice._

> **‚Äî go'i**
> _‚Äî He doesn't (love)._

In order to say "No, he does love her" we use the needed verb directly:

> **‚Äî la .bob. na ku prami la .alis.**
> _Bob doesn't love Alice._

> **‚Äî ja'a ku go'i**
> _Bob does love Alice._

Here, **ja'a ku** replaces **na ku** in the original relation. -->

### Time of day

> **‚Äî ma tcika ti**
> _What's the time?_

<!-- -->

> **‚Äî li cacra bu pa pa**
> _Eleven hours_

tcika
: $x_1$ (hours, minutes, seconds) is the time of event $x_2$

In Lojban times are always the times of something. So we ask what the time is of **ti**, meaning _this event/thing_, or, in other words _now_.

**li**, a prefix for numbers, is used for timestamps too.

- **cacra bu** is a prefix signalling that the number of hours follows. 24-hour time is used almost always in Lojban.
- **mentu bu** is a prefix signalling that the number of minutes follows.
- **snidu bu** is a prefix signalling that the number of seconds follows.

> **li cacra bu pa pa mentu bu pa no**
> _11:10 (Ten minutes past eleven)_

<!-- -->

> **li cacra bu pa pa mentu bu pa no snidu bu pa ci**
> _11 hours, 10 minutes and 13 seconds._

<!-- -->

> **li cacra bu pa no mentu bu mu no**
> _10:50, ten to eleven_

If we want to give the time of an event, rather than just tell the time, the second place is filled:

> **li cacra bu pa no tcika le nu mi klama**
> _Ten o'clock is the time that I come._

By using the term **de'i** we can get a more naturally sounding sentence:

> **mi klama de'i li cacra bu pa no**
> _I am coming at 10 o'clock._

de'i
: at ‚Ä¶ (time), on ‚Ä¶ (date)

And one useful example:

> **ca tcika le nu .ei sipna**
> _It's time to sleep._

### Dates

> **‚Äî ma detri ti**
> _What's the date today?_

> **‚Äî li mastu bu ze djedi bu pa**
> _It's July, 1._

detri
: $x_1$ (year, month, day) is the date/time of event $x_2$

Another option:

> **‚Äî ma ca detri**
> _‚Äî What is the date now?_

- **nanca bu** is a prefix signalling that the year follows.
- **masti bu** is a prefix signalling that the month follows.
- **jefydei bu** is a prefix signalling that the day of week follows.
- **djedi bu** is a prefix signalling that the day follows.

Prefixes with numbers after them can be used in any order (let's use digits to show numbers):

> **li djedi bu 2 ca detri**
> _It's the second day of the month now._

<!-- -->

> **li masti bu 4 djedi bu 1 ca detri**
> _It's April, the first now._

<!-- -->

> **li djedi bu 5 masti bu 7 nanca bu 2005 detri le nu mi jbena**
> _The fifth of July (seventh month), year 2005 is when I was born._

jbena
: $x_1$ is born

We can also use **de'i**:

> **mi ba klama de'i li masti bu pano**
> _I will come in October._

Particles in Lojban can be written without spaces in between like in this **pano**, which is the same as **pa no**.

For days of week usually Monday is the first day:

> **mi gunka de'i li jefydei bu pa**
> _I work on Monday._

<!-- -->

> **mi gunka ca ro se detri be li jefydei bu re**
> _I work every Tuesday._

<!-- -->

> **xu do pu zvati la .paris. de'i li jefydei bu ci**
> _Were you in Paris on Wednesday?_

### Specifying time intervals

> **mi nanca li re re**
> _I am 22 years old._

nanca
: $x_1$ is of duration of $x_2$ (number) years

**nanca** specifies the duration, and in order too say _two years long_ you fill the second place with a number prefixed with **li**.

> **le verba cu masti li re**
> _The child is two months old._

masti
: $x_1$ is $x_2$ months long

> **le nu carvi cu djedi li ci**
> _It's raining for three days._

djedi
: $x_1$ (event) is $x_2$ (number) full days long

<!-- ### New verbs from one scale

>**mi na'e nelci do**
>_I other than like you._

"Left scalar" particles (to which **na'e** belongs) are put to the left of constructs they affect and form a scale:

- **je'a** = _indeed (the affirmative position on the scale)_. The word **je'a** confirms the meaning of a part of sentence. Usually it's just omitted.

		>**mi je'a nelci do**
		>_I indeed like you._

- **na'e** = _non- (other than the affirmative position on the scale)_

		>**mi na'e nelci do**
		>_I other than like you._

- **no'e** = _not really (midpoint on the scale)_. The word **no'e** makes a part of sentence middle in its meaning.

			>**mi no'e nelci do**
			>_As for whether I love or hate you, I'm indifferent to you. I neither like nor hate you._

- **to'e** = _anti-, dis-, mis- etc. (opposite on the scale)_. The word **to'e** makes a part of sentence opposite in its meaning. It's similar to English _anti-_.

			>**mi to'e nelci do**
			>_I hate you._
			>`I anti-like you`

**na'e** is more vague than **no'e** and **to'e**, it can mean any of them when you don't care about the exact meaning. -->

## Lesson 8. Terms and math

### ‚Äò_Possibly can_‚Äô, ‚Äò_have been_‚Äô and ‚Äò_haven't yet been_‚Äô

<!-- -->

> **le'e cipni ka'e vofli**
> _Birds can fly._

<!-- -->

> **le pendo be mi ca'a xendo prenu**
> _My friend shows himself as a friendly person._

<!-- -->

> **le pendo be mi ka'e litru bu'u ro da**
> _A friend of mine can travel in any place._

<!-- -->

> **mi ca'a zvati la .madrid.**
> _I am in Madrid._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu'i zvati la .madrid.**
> _I have been to Madrid._

<!-- -->

> **mi nu'o zvati la .madrid.**
> _I have never been to Madrid._

ka'e
: term of potential: possibly can

ca'a
: term of potential: actually is

pu'i
: term of potential: has already happened

nu'o
: term of potential: hasn't ever happened

This series of so called terms of potential describes possible situations.

Note that **ka'e** means that an event can happen whereas, for example,

> **le'e cipni cu kakne le ka vofli**
> _Birds are capable of flying._

describes abilities dependent on actions of participants.

### ‚Äò_Plus_‚Äô and ‚Äò_minus_‚Äô

<!-- -->

> **li mu du li re su'i ci**
> _Five equals two plus three._

**li** that we saw earlier is similar to **le** but it starts a mathematical expression (or just a number or a timestamp).

Note that **li re su'i ci** (_2+3_) is one single expression considered as one noun.

**du** is a verb and means _to be equal to_.

- **su'i** means _plus_.
- **vu'u** means _minus_.
- **pi'i** means _times_ and is used for multiplication
- **fe'i** means _divided by_ and is used for division.

**pi** is a decimal separator so **no pi mu** means _0.5_, **ci ze pi pa so** means _37.19_.

In some notations 0.35 can be written as .35 and in Lojban we can also drop zero saying **pi mu**.

Here are some other examples.

> **li pare fe'i ci du li vo**
> _12 : 3 = 4._

<!-- -->

> **li re pi'i re du li vo**
> _two times two is four_

<!-- -->

> **li pano vu'u mu pi'i re du li no**
> _10 ‚Äî 5 ‚ãÖ 2 = 0._

Notice that you put **li** only once before the equation and once after it. Thus _12 : 3_ is considered one number. Indeed, _4_ is the same as _12 : 3_. They are both numbers.

For asking for a number we use **ma**:

> **li ci su'i vo du ma**
> _3 + 4 = ?_

<!-- -->

> **li ze**
> _7_

### ‚Äò_First_‚Äô, ‚Äò_second_‚Äô, ‚Äò_last_‚Äô

Ordinal numbers such as _first_, _second_, _third_ are used to put things in order. In Lojban they are formed with a number plus **moi** immediately after it:

pa moi
: $x_1$ is first among $x_2$ (set)

re moi
: $x_1$ is second among $x_2$ (set)

ci moi
: $x_1$ is third among $x_2$ (set)

‚Ä¶

ro moi
: $x_1$ is last among $x_2$ (set)

It is also possible to use verbs instead of numbers:

me mi moi
: $x_1$ is mine

me do moi
: $x_1$ is yours

In this case we had to convert pronouns to verbs using **me**.

> **le prenu cu pa moi le'i se prami be mi**
> _He is my first love._

<!-- -->

> **tu ro moi le'i ratcu pe mi**
> _That is my last rat._

<!-- -->

> **le cerni tarci cu ro moi le'i tarci poi cumki fa le nu viska ke'a pu le nu co'a donri**
> _The morning star is the last star that's visible before the dawning of the day._

<!-- -->

> **tu me mi moi**
> _That's mine._

<!-- -->

> **tu me mi moi le'i stizu**
> **tu me mi moi stizu** (using a compound verb, tanru for conciseness)

> _That's my place._

<!-- -->

> **.i ti voi stizu cu me mi moi le'i pa ci stizu poi jibni le jubme**
> _This place is mine among the 13 places near the table._

Cardinal numbers are placed before ordinal numbers in a string and separated by **boi**:

> **le ci boi pa moi be le'i kabri pe le ckafi**
> _the first three cups of coffee_

Without **boi** it would turn into **ci pa moi** ‚Äî _thirty-first_.

### ¬´**gau**¬ª ‚Äî make them do it

The term **gau** marks the agent of event:

> **le canko cu kalri**
> _The window is open._

<!-- -->

> **le canko gau do kalri**
> _You open the window._
> `The window driven-by you is open`

gau
: modal term: caused by ‚Ä¶ (agent), driven by ‚Ä¶ (someone, some object)

kalri
: $x_1$ is open

Thus, such verbs as _to open something_, _to move something_ can be rephrased as _to make something open_, _to make something move_ and therefore we don't need to learn extra verbs for every such meaning. Instead we add the term **gau** all the time.

There is also another method that retains the same order of words as in English:

> **le canko gau ko kalri**
> **ko jai gau kalri fai le canko**
> _Open the window!_

Here we transform the verb **kalri** ‚Äî _to be open_ into a verb

jai gau kalri
: to open something

The first place of **kalri** can be shown by using a place tag **fai**.

Some more variations:

> **le pa karce cu muvdu**
> _The car moves._

<!-- -->

> **ko jai gau muvdu fai le karce**
> **le karce gau ko muvdu**
> _Move the car! Make the car move!_

<!-- -->

> **le karce cu muvdu ti**
> **fa le karce cu muvdu fe ti**
> _The car moves here._

<!-- -->

> **ko jai gau muvdu fai le karce fe ti**
> _Move the car here!_

**muvdu** ‚Äî _moves to some place_ is transformed into a new verb **jai gau muvdu** ‚Äî _to move something or someone to some place_.

muvdu
: $x_1$ moves to $x_2$ from $x_3$ via $x_4$

jai gau muvdu fai le karce
: $x_1$ moves the car to $x_2$ from $x_3$ via $x_4$

> **la .alis. cu klama**
> _Alice comes._

<!-- -->

> **la .alis. gau ko klama**
> _Make Alice come!_

### ‚Äò_Why_?‚Äô ‚Äî ¬´**ri'a**¬ª, ¬´**ni'i**¬ª, ¬´**mu'i**¬ª, ¬´**ki'u**¬ª

> **- ri'a ma carvi**
> _- Why is it raining?_

> **- le nu le dilnu ca klaku**
> _- Because the clouds are crying._

ri'a
: modal term: because of ‚Ä¶ (some event)

ri'a ma
: why?

klaku
: $x_1$ cries

Unlike **gau** the term **ri'a** expects not an agent, but an event like _the clouds are crying_:

> **le dilnu cu klaku ri'a le nu le dargu cu cilmo**
> _Skies are crying resulting in the road being wet._

_Therefore_ is the reverse word compared to _because_:

> **le dilnu cu klaku .i se ri'a bo le dargu cu cilmo**
> _Skies are crying. Therefore the road is wet._

cilmo
: ... is wet

Another type of _why_ is **ni'i**:

> **- ni'i ma nicte**
> **- le nu le solri na ku te gusni**
> _- Why is it night?_
> _- Because the sun is not shining._

<!-- -->

> **le solri na ku te gusni .i se ni'i bo nicte**
> _The sun is not shining. Therefore, it's night._

ni'i
: modal term: logically because of ‚Ä¶

se ni'i
: modal term: with the logical consequence that ‚Ä¶, logically therefore

Here we can't use **ri'a** as we are talking not about a result but about logical implication. The fact that it is night just logically follows from the sun not shining.

> **mi darxi la .kevin. mu'i le nu ky. lacpu le kerfa be mi**
> _I hit Kevin because he pulled my hair._

mu'i
: term: because (of motive ‚Ä¶)

In this example, what we have is not two events which are physically connected, like clouds and rain, but three events:

1. Kevin pulls my hair.
2. I decide, as a result of this, to hit Kevin.
3. I hit Kevin.

English misses out the second event and says _Sally hit Joey because he pulled her hair._ However, this is not only vague but, some would say, psychologically dangerous. People do not generally react to stimuli automatically, but as a result of motivation, and confusing complex responses with simple physical causation may lead us to believe that we have no control over our emotions or even our actions. Thus, it is often useful to say not just physical reactions (**ri'a**) but emphasize responses which have a cognitive/emotional element (**mu'i**).

> **le ctuca pu plicru la .ben. le jemna ki'u le nu by. pu zabna gunka**
> _The teacher gave to Ben the gem as a present because he worked nice._

le ctuca
: the teacher

le jemna
: the gem

zabna
: $x_1$ is cool, nice

gunka
: $x_1$ works

ki'u
: modal term: because (due to explanation ‚Ä¶)

The difference between motivation and justification is not always clear, but we can say that justification involves some rule or standard while motivation does not require it. Compare:

> **le ctuca pu plicru la .ben. le jemna ki'u le nu by. pu zabna gunka**
> _The teacher gave Ben the gem as a present motivated by his work nice._

This says only that Ben's hard work motivated the teacher to give him the gem whereas with **ki'u** we might imply that it is the custom for teachers to give gems as a reward for good work.

Note: Don't get **ki'u** mixed up with **ku'i** which means _but, however_.

**ki'u** appeals to more general considerations than **mu'i**, but it still deals with human standards, not logical laws. Only a very naive student would believe that if a student is given a gem, it must logically imply that that student has worked nice.

In the case **ni'i ma nicte**, however, the fact that the Sun isn't shining it is night logically entails that the Sun isn't shining. Here we can confidently use **ni'i**.

### ‚Äò_So ‚Ä¶ that_‚Äô

The expression _so ‚Ä¶ that_ is expressed in Lojban by splitting the sentence into two:

> **mi tai galtu plipe .i ja'e bo mi farlu**
> _I jumped so high that I fell down._

ja'e
: modal term: with the result of ‚Ä¶

tai
: modal term: in the manner of ‚Ä¶

Other examples:

> **mi tai zukte**
> _I act this way_

<!-- -->

> **mi tai fengu**
> _I am so angry._

fengu
: $x_1$ is angry at $x_2$ (clause) for action $x_3$ (property of $x_2$)

### ‚Äò_If ‚Ä¶ then_‚Äô

> **ba ku fau le nu do cizra kei mi prami do**
> _If you are strange then I'll love you._

fau
: modal term: with the event of ‚Ä¶, under circumstances ‚Ä¶, concurrently with ‚Ä¶

**fau** is much like **ca** (_when_) or **bu'u** (_at (some place)_).

In many cases we can replace **fau** with **ca** getting almost the same meaning (sometimes more precise):

> **mi ba prami do ca le nu do cizra**
> _I'll love you when you are strange._

We can replace **le** with **ro lo** in such terms getting a new meaning:

> **mi ba prami do ca ro lo nu do cizra**
> _I'll love you whenever you are strange._

### ¬´**fau**¬ª and ¬´**da'i**¬ª. ‚Äò_What if ‚Ä¶_‚Äô

> **da'i mi turni**
> _I could be a governor._

<!-- -->

> **da'i nai mi turni**
> _I am a governor._

- The interjection **da'i** marks the relation in which it is put as describing an imaginary event.
- The opposite interjection **da'i nai** marks the relation as describing an actual, real event.

Constructs with **da'i** are usually translated to English with so called auxiliary verbs such as _can/could, will/would, may/might, should_ and _must_. Relations marked with **da'i** in English are said to be in _subjunctive mood_.

Omitting **da'i** or **da'i nai** makes the sentence clear only from context which is usually quite transparent. That's why **da'i** or **da'i nai** is not obligatory. We use it for clarity when needed.

Relations with **da'i** may include the term with **fau**:

> **da'i mi gleki fau le nu mi ponse le rupnusudu be li pa ki'o ki'o**
> _I would/could be happy if I had one million dollars._

fau
: with the event of ‚Ä¶

rupnusudu
: $x_1$ costs $x_2$ (number) US dollars

pa ki'o ki'o
: 1 million

> **mo da'i fau le nu mi cusku lu ie nai li'u**
> _What if I say "no"?_

Here the event inside **fau** is equally imagined together with **mi gleki**. And here is the reverse example:

> **da'i nai mi gleki fau le nu mi ponse le rupnusudu be li pa ki'o ki'o**
> _Having one million dollars I am happy._

In many circumstances the word **fau** can be safely replaced with just **ca** (_at the same time as ‚Ä¶_):

> **da'i nai mi gleki ca le nu do klama**
> _I'm happy when you come._

Other prepositions can be used when necessary:

> **da'i mi denpa ze'a le nu do limna**
> _I would wait while you took a swim._

denpa
: $x_1$ waits for $x_2$ (event)‚Ä¶

ze'a
: through some time, for a while, during ‚Ä¶

limna
: $x_1$ swims

### Probabilities

Suppose you come home and hear someone scratching. You can say one of the following sentences:

> **fau su'o da tu mlatu**
> **fau da tu mlatu**
> _This might be/possibly is a cat. It is possible that this is a cat._
> (You keep several animals at home. So it might be your cat scratching but you are not sure.)

<!-- -->

> **fau ro da tu mlatu**
> _this must be/certainly is the cat._
> (You have a cat and such noise can be produced by only one object, that cat.)

<!-- -->

> **fau so'e da tu mlatu**
> _This should be/probably is the cat._
> (If you have a dog then it can also produce such sounds but your dog usually doesn't do that so the cat is more likely.)

<!-- -->

> **fau so'u da tu mlatu**
> _It is not probable that this is the cat._

<!-- -->

> **fau no da tu mlatu**
> _This can't be the cat. This mustn't be the cat. It is impossible that this is the cat._

Notice that we omitted **da'i** for brevity. But if we want to be explicitly clear about the events being imaginary **da'i** in these examples is to be put inside the **fau** relation:

1. **fau da'i da** denotes that the event in this relation _is possible, may/can possibly happen._
2. **fau da'i ro da** ‚Äî the event _would necessarily happen._
3. **fau da'i so'e da** ‚Äî the event _is probable, will probably happen, is likely to happen._
4. **fau da'i so'o da** ‚Äî the event _is remotely probable, could/might happen._
5. **fau da'i so'u da** ‚Äî the event _is not likely, probably doesn't happen._
6. **fau da'i no da** ‚Äî the event _is not possible._

The difference between these is in the number of imaginary situations we take into account. We don't describe those situations, we just mark them as **da** (_something_) letting the context (or our listeners) decide what those situations are.

### Possibility implied in places of relations

Some verbs have **da'i** implied in some of their places when you don't use **da'i** explicitly:

> **mi pacna le nu do ba pluka sipna**
> _I hope you will have a pleasant sleep._

pacna
: $x_1$ hopes for $x_2$ (possible event) with likelihood $x_3$ (number, by default **li so'a** i.e. close to 1)

> **mi kanpe le nu do klama**
> _I expect you to come._

<!-- -->

> **mi kanpe le nu do ba jinga kei li so'e**
> _You'll probably win._
> `I expect with a high probability that you will win.`

<!-- -->

> **mi kanpe le nu mi cortu fau ro lo nu su'o lo rokci cu farlu le tuple be mi**
> _I know for a fact that if a rock lands on my foot, it will hurt._

kanpe
: $x_1$ expects $x_2$ (possible event) with expected likelihood $x_3$ (a number from 0 till 1, the default value is **li so'a**, i.e. near 1)

Unlike **pacna** the verb **kanpe** doesn't necessarily imply hope or wish. It can describe impartial expectation, subjective evaluation of the probability of a situation.

> **cumki fa le nu do jinga**
> _It is possible that you win._

<!-- -->

> **- xu ba carvi**
> **- cumki**
> _- Will it rain?_
> _- Maybe._

cumki
: $x_1$ (possible event) is possible, $x_1$ may, might occur, $x_1$ is a maybe.

> **- xu ba carvi**
> **- lakne**
> _- Will it rain?_
> _- Probably._

lakne
: $x_1$ (possible event) is probable, likely

> **mi djica le nu do jinga**
> _I want you to win._

<!-- -->

> **mi djica le nu mi klama la .paris.**
> _I would rather visit Paris. I want to visit Paris._

djica
: $x_1$ wants $x_2$ (possible event)

> **mi te mukti le ka klama la .paris.**
> _I will visit Paris. I motivated to visit Paris._

<!-- -->

> **mi te mukti klama la .paris.**
> _I'm visiting Paris intentionally._

te mukti
: $x_1$ is motivated to bring about goal $x_2$ (possible event) by motive $x_3$ (event)

> **mi kakne le ka limna**
> _I am able to swim._

<!-- -->

> **mi pu kakne le ka gunka**
> _I could work. I was able to work._

kakne
: $x_1$ can, is able to do $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

$x_2$ describes a possible event.

> **mi te javni le ka gunka**
> _I should work._

te javni
: $x_1$ should/ought to do $x_2$ (property of $x_1$) under rule $x_3$ (proposition)

$x_2$ describes a possible event.

> **do na ku te javni le ka tcidu**
> _You don't have to read._

na ku te javni
: $x_1$ doesn't have to, needn't to do $x_2$ (property of $x_1$) under rule $x_3$ (proposition)

$x_2$ describes a possible event.

> **mi nitcu le nu mi sipna**
> _I need to sleep._

nitcu
: $x_1$ needs $x_2$ (possible event)

> **mi bilga le ka gunka**
> _I must work. I am obliged to work._

bilga
: $x_1$ must, is obliged to do $x_2$ (property of $x_1$)

> **mi curmi le nu do citka ti**
> _I allow you to eat this._

curmi
: $x_1$ allows/permits $x_2$ (possible event)

> **mi tolcru le nu do nerkla**
> _I forbid you to enter._

tolcru
: $x_1$ forbids/prohibits $x_2$ (possible event)

> **xu do stidi le ka sipna kei mi**
> _Do you suggest that I sleep?_

stidi
: $x_1$ inspires $x_2$ (possible action) in actor $x_3$

<!-- >**mi na ku birti le du'u ra klama**
>_I'm not sure if he comes._

birti
: $x_1$ is sure that $x_2$ (proposition) is true -->

> **mi senpi le du'u ra kakne le ka limna**
> _I doubt that he can swim._

senpi
: $x_1$ doubts that $x_2$ (proposition) is true

<!-- **senpi** is the same as **na'e birti** -->

> **mi se xanri le nu mi pavyseljirna**
> _I imagine myself being a unicorn. I could be a unicorn._

<!-- -->

> **se xanri**
> _$x_1$ imagines $x_2$ (possible event)_

<!-- -->

> **xanri**
> _$x_1$ (possible event) is imagined by $x_2$_

## Lesson 9. Logical conjunctions

Basic logical conjunctions in Lojban are based on 4 primitive ones: **.a**, **.e**, **.o**, **.u**. Here we'll cover them in detail.

### Logical conjunctions for nouns

Here are the conjunctions combining two words: _this_ and _that_.

- **ti .a ta** = _this and/or that_

  > **mi ba vitke le mamta .a le tamne**
  >_I'll visit the mother or the cousin._

  Note that **.a** can also be translated as _at least one of the two values_ and thus leaves open the possibility that I will get round to visiting both of them at some point.

- **ti .e ta** = _this and that_

  > **mi ralte le pa gerku .e le re mlatu**
  >_I've got a dog and two cats._
  >`I keep one dog and two cat.`

- **ti .o ta** = _either this and that, or none_

  > **mi ba vitke le mamta .o le tamne**
  >_I will visit either both the mother and the cousin, or none of them_

- **ti .u ta** = _this, and perhaps that_, _this whether or not that_

  > **mi ba vitke le mamta .u le tamne**
  >_I'll visit the mother whether or not I'll visit the cousin._

  **.u** just emphasizes that the second value does not affect the truth of the sentence.

Placing **nai** after a conjunction negates what is to the right of it. Placing **na** before a conjunction negates what is to the left of it:

- **ti .e nai ta** = _this and not that_

  > **mi nelci la .bob. e nai la .alis.**
  >_I like Bob but not Alice._
  >`I like Bob and not Alice`

  We can also say **ti .e nai ku'i ta** (_this but not that_) adding a flavor of contrast for the second noun.

- **ti na .e ta** = _not this but that_

  > **mi nelci la .alis. na .e la .bob.**
  >_I don't like Alice but I do like Bob._
  >`I like Alice not and Bob`

  This may sound a bit weird for English speakers (`I like Alice not‚Ä¶`) so you might prefer to swap the nouns and use **.e nai** instead: **mi nelci la .bob. e nai la .alis.** or even **mi nelci la .bob. i mi na ku nelci la .alis.** will mean the same.

- **ti na .e nai ta** = _neither this nor that (none)_

  > **mi nelci la .alis. na .e nai la .bob.**
  >_I don't like neither Alice nor Bob_

Negating with other primitive conjunctions might not look intuitively usable, you can just learn them from examples:

- **ti .a nai ta** = _this if that_, _for this the exclusive condition to happen is that_

  > **mi ba vitke le mamta .a nai le tamne**
  >_I will visit the mother but for that to happen I need to visit the cousin._

  Thus **ti .a nai ta** means that **ta** is necessary (but may not be the only condition) for **ti** to be applied.

- **ti .o nai ta** = _either this or that_

  > **mi ba vitke le mamta .o nai le tamne**
  > _I'll visit either the mother or the cousin._

  If I want to say that that I will visit either the mother or the cousin but not both, I need **.o nai** (_either/or_). It's unlike **.a** (_and/or_) where I can visit both of them.

- **ti na .u ta** = doesn't influence _(not this, but perhaps that)_
- **ti na .u nai ta** = doesn't influence _(not this, but perhaps that)_

- **ti se .u ta** = _perhaps this, and that_
- **ti se .u nai ta** = _perhaps this but not that_

**se** is used only for **.u** because in other cases it leads to no effect in meaning.

These are used for connecting nouns. For connecting parts of compound verbs we use similar conjunctions: **ja**, **je**, **jo**, **ju**. So instead of the dot (pause) we use **j** here.

<!-- It's common to use **ja**, **je**, **jo**, **ju** for connecting nouns too. -->

### Logical conjunctions for sentences

> **mi ralte le pa gerku .e le re mlatu**
> _I've got a dog and two cats._
> `I keep one dog and two cat.`

This is actually a contracted way of saying:

> **mi ralte le pa gerku .i je mi ralte le re mlatu**
> _It is true that I have a dog. It is true that I have two cats._

**.i je** joins two sentences with a logical _and_, showing that two sentences are part of one thought and that both sentences are true.

Here are examples for other conjunctions for sentences:

> **la .rome'os. cu prami la .djuliet. i je la .djuliet. cu prami la .rome'os.**
> _Romeo loves Juliet <u>and</u> Juliet loves Romeo_

means that both statements are true, i.e. Romeo and Juliet love each other.

The same is applicable to other conjunctions:

> **la .rome'os. cu prami la .djuliet. i ja la .djuliet. cu prami la .rome'os.**
> _Romeo loves Juliet and/or Juliet loves Romeo_

means that one of them loves the other, and perhaps both of them do.

> **la .rome'os. cu prami la .djuliet. i jo nai la .djuliet. cu prami la .rome'os.**
> _Either Romeo loves Juliet or Juliet loves Romeo._

Here either Romeo loves Juliet (but Juliet doesn't love him), or Juliet loves Romeo (but he doesn't love her).

> **la .rome'os. cu prami la .djuliet. i ja nai la .djuliet. cu prami la .rome'os.**
> _For Romeo to love Juliet it's necessary that Juliet loves Romeo._

means that if Juliet loves Romeo, he definitely loves her, but he may love her anyway (the only outcome which is impossible is that Juliet loves Romeo but he doesn't love her).

> **la .rome'os. cu prami la .djuliet. i jo la .djuliet. cu prami la .rome'os.**
> _Either Romeo loves Juliet and Juliet loves Romeo, or none of the two events happens._

means that if Juliet loves Romeo, he loves her, and if she doesn't love him, he doesn't love her.

> **la .rome'os. cu prami la .djuliet. i ju la .djuliet. cu prami la .rome'os.**
> _Romeo loves Juliet whether or not Juliet loves Romeo._

Notice how we Lojbanize the name "Romeo": combination "eo" is impossible in Lojban so we used "e'o" and added a consonant in the end for his name.

Note that **da** refers to the same entity when several sentences are connected to each other using conjunctions or with tense particles with **bo** (like **ba bo**). So if I say **da klama le barja .i je da cizra** you can assume I'm referring to the same person in both sentences.

### Logical conjunctions for compound verbs

> **le melbi xunre fonxa**
> _beautifully red phones_

<!-- -->

> **le melbi je xunre fonxa**
> _beautiful and red phones_

Other conjunctions also make sense:

> **mi nelci ro tu voi xajmi ja melbi prenu**
> _I likes all of funny or handsome (or both) persons._

<!-- -->

> **mi nelci ro tu voi xajmi jo nai melbi prenu**
> _I likes all of either funny or beautiful persons._

this might be explained if, for example, I find the qualities of humor and good looks incompatible, i.e. a mixture of the two would be just too much.

> **mi nelci ro tu voi xajmi ju melbi nanmu**
> _I likes all of funny (whether or not beautiful) persons._

And once again we shouldn't forget the difference between connecting nouns and connecting parts of compound verbs:

> **mi ba vitke le pa pendo .e le pa speni**
> _I will visit a friend and a spouse._

<!-- -->

> **mi ba vitke le pa pendo je speni**
> _I will visit a friend-and-spouse_

The last Lojban sentence means that the friend is also a spouse.

### Logical conjunctions for relation tails

> **pu ku mi uantida la .soker. gi'e klama le zdani gi'e citka le badna**
> _I played soccer, went home, ate the banana._

uantida
: a non-official verb: $x_1$ plays the game, participates in the game $x_2$

**gi'e** connects several relations into one with some nouns shared. Look at this: It expands into **pu ku mi kelci la .soker. i je pu ku mi klama le zdani** ‚Ä¶ which would be lengthier.

With **gi'e** we keep the head of the relation constant, and specify nouns after each of the verb (**kelci la .soker.**, **klama le zdani** ‚Ä¶)

Thus when using **gi'e** we have several relations in the tail joined together but having a common head.

**gi'e** has the same final vowel as in **je** and thus means _and_.

Other conjunctions for joining relation tails:

- **gi'a** for _and/or_
- **gi'o nai** for _either ‚Ä¶ or_
- **gi'u** for _whether or not_ etc.

So they have the same ending as conjunctions of **.a** series.

### Terms in sentences with several tails

Note that tenses as terms and tenses attached to the main relation of the relation make a difference when applied to sentences that contains several attached relations:

- term in the head of the sentence is applied to all its tails:

  > **mi ba'o cu citka le badna gi'e pinxe**
  > _I no longer eat the banana and no longer drink._

  Here, **ba'o** is applied to **citka le badna gi'e pinxe**.

- tense word that is a part of the verb is applied to that relation only:

  > **mi ba'o citka le badna gi'e pinxe**
  > _I no longer eat the banana, I do drink._

  Here, **ba'o** is applied to **citka le badna** only.

### Choice questions

Another type of English _or_ can be found in questions:

> **‚Äî xu do pinxe le tcati .o nai le ckafi?**
> **‚Äî pinxe**
> _‚Äî Will you drink tea or coffee?_
> _‚Äî Yes._

That's a weird but a perfectly reasonable answer: _Yes, I will drink tea or coffee._

Why this happens is because _or_ has several meanings in English:

1. _A or B_ can mean _either A, or B but not both_. We use **.onai** here.
2. _A or B_ can mean _A or B or both_. We use **.a** here.
3. _A or B?_ can be a question meaning _select from A and B, which of them do you choose?_ We use **ji** here.

Thus in the last case we use a separate question conjunction **ji**:

> **‚Äî do pinxe le tcati ji le ckafi?**
> _‚Äî Will you drink tea or coffee?_

Possible answers:

> **le tcati .e le ckafi**
> _Tea and coffee._

<!-- -->

> **le tcati**
> _Tea._

<!-- -->

> **le ckafi**
> _Coffee._

It is also possible to use conjunctions when replying:

> **.e** ‚Äî <span>_Both_ (the first and the second item is chosen)</span>

<!-- -->

> **.e nai** ‚Äî <span>_The first one (tea)_ (the first but not the second one is chosen)</span>

<!-- -->

> **na .e** ‚Äî <span>_The second one (coffee)_ (not the first but the second one is chosen)</span>

<!-- -->

> **na .e nai** ‚Äî _Neither_ (not the first and not the second one is chosen)

You can ask questions in the same way about the other kinds of conjunctions we have looked at. The interrogative conjunction for relation tails is **gi'i**, for compound verbs ‚Äî **je'i**, for sentences ‚Äî **.i je'i**.

Indirect questions are achieved by using **ji kau**:

Consider the waiter asks a visitor

> **- le'e dembi ji le'e rismi**
> _- The beans or the rice?_

Once the visitor answers, the waiter knows whether the visitor wants to eat lamb or beef:

> **ba le nu le vitke cu spusku kei le bevri cu djuno le du'u le vitke cu djica le nu ri citka le'e dembi ji kau le'e rismi**
> _After the visitor replies, the waiter knows whether the visitor wants to eat the beans or the rice._

### Forethought conjunctions

> **ge do gi mi**
> _both you and I_

<!-- -->

> **ge nai do gi mi**
> _Not you but I_

<!-- -->

> **ge do gi nai mi**
> _You but not I_

<!-- -->

> **go nai do gi mi**
> _Either you or I_

Forethought conjunction **ge** means _and_ but it's placed before the first noun. **gi** separates the two nouns. The series is parallel to other conjunctions. It is **ga**, **ge**, **go**, **gu** and also **ga nai**, **ge nai**, **go nai** etc. The separator **gi** is the same for all of them.

Using such conjunctions is a matter of convenience:

> **mi citka ge nai le badna gi le plise**
> _I eat not the banana but the apple._

Here, like in English _not_ is stated before the first noun.

**ge** and words in this series can still be used for connecting relations too:

> **ge mi dansu gi mi zgipli le pipno**
> _I both dance and play the piano._

zgipli
: $x_1$ plays musical instrument $x_2$

le pipno
: piano

> **.i ga nai pu zi carvi gi ca cilmo**
> _If it has been raining recently, it's wet now._

## Lesson 10. Structuring text

### ¬´**ju'a**¬ª and assertions

> **le prenu cu cizra .i ji'a je la .alis. cu jinvi le du'u go'i**
> _The person is strange. And Alice thinks that too._

<!-- -->

> **la .alis. cu jinvi le du'u le prenu cu cizra**
> _Alice has an opinion that the person is strange._

By default the main relation of sentence asserts some information. Relations inside places or relations that are relative relations may not be asserted. In the last example that the man is strange is not asserted by the speaker. It's only Alice's opinion.

The interjection **ju'a** makes the relation asserted by the speaker. The first sentence can be thus rephrased as:

> **la .alis. cu jinvi le du'u ju'a le prenu cu cizra**
> _Alice has an opinion that the person is strange, and it is so._

English often fails to translate this powerful **ju'a** concisely, thus the English translation doesn't follow the word order of the Lojban original.

One more example:

> **mi nelci le nu do dansu**
> _I like when you dance._

<!-- -->

> **mi nelci le nu ju'a do dansu**
> _I like that you dance._

In the second case the speaker asserts _You dance_.

### ¬´**pe'a**¬ª for metaphors, ¬´**za'e**¬ª for nonce words, ¬´**ba'e**¬ª for emphasis

> **le ninmu cu tarci pe'a .i va'i ri misno**
> _The woman is a "star". I other words, she is famous._

pe'a
: interjection: marks a construct as metaphorically used.

tarci
: $x_1$ is a star

**tarci** denotes real stars, objects in the sky. The interjection **pe'a** transforms it into a metaphorical meaning.

> **.i ba ku mi pu viska le cizra stuzi poi le fagri cu nenri .i mi pu klama za'e le fagrystu**
> _And then I saw a strange place with a fire inside. I came to that (how to say) "fire-place"._

za'e
: left interjection: marks the following construct as used not in its usual meaning

Left interjections like their name suggests are put before a construct modified (whereas other interjections are put after it).

The left interjection **za'e** shows that the following construct, **le fagrystu** in this case, is made up or used not in its standard meaning, i.e. there wouldn't be need to look up in the dictionary or ask the speaker specifically about the meaning of this word since the word is used to further describe the story.

> **ba'e la .alis. e nai la .kevin. pu darxi mi**
> _Alice, not Kevin hit me!_

<!-- -->

> **mi djuno le du'u ma kau pu darxi ba'e mi .i ku'i mi na ku djuno le du'u ma kau pu darxi do**
> _I know who hit me. But I don't know who hit you._

ba'e
: left interjection: puts an emphasis on the following construct

To emphasize a word we would use stress in spoken English, and underlining, italics or capital letters in written English.

In Lojban we use the left interjection **ba'e**.

### Paragraphs and separating sentences

**ni'o** works exactly like **.i** but starts a new paragraph. Paragraphs are usually associated with new topics.

It is normal to use in speech only **.i** to separate sentence but you might want to use **ni'o** especially in a written text to structure it.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>ni'o</td>
  <td></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>.i le pa nintadni cu klama le ctuca bu'u le galtu bu'u le darno cmana</td>
  <td>A newbie visited the master far high in the mountains.</td>

 <tr>
  <td>.i su'o di zo'u le dirgo be le djacu co'a pagbu da poi zmadu fi le ka banli</td>
  <td>A drop of water becomes a part of something greater.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

dirgo
: $x_1$ is a drop of material $x_2$ ‚Ä¶

### ¬´**to**¬ª ‚Ä¶ ¬´**toi**¬ª for parenthetical remarks

Comments that we place inside parentheses in English text are formed using the word **to** instead of the left parenthesis and **toi** instead of the right parenthesis:

> **ti poi to vi'o nai do mi na ku djica tu'a su'o lo drata toi plise cu fusra**
> _This (no, I don't want another one!) apple is rotten._

djica
: to desire

drata
: ‚Ä¶ is different from ‚Ä¶

plise
: $x_1$ is an apple

fusra
: $x_1$ rots or decays with agent $x_2$

Such parenthetical remarks can go anywhere interjections can ‚Äî meaning pretty much anywhere in a Lojban sentence. With parentheses, just like with quotes, you need to know where the parenthesis starts, and where it ends.

### Fixing errors in speech

When screwing a sentence up, knowing how to correct yourself is a good idea. You can use two words to delete your previous words:

si
: deletion: deletes last word only

sa
: deletion: deletes back until next cmavo spoken

The function of them is obvious: they delete words as if they have never been spoken. They do not work inside certain quotes (all quotes except **lu‚Ä¶li'u**), though, as that would leave it impossible to quote these words. Several **si** in a row deletes several words.

When you make a mistake while speaking (factual or grammatical) in English you don't normally bother to correct it even if you realize you made a mistake in the first place. That's because English is fairly redundant (for this very reason!). In English if we catch ourselves making an error, we stumble out a correction that will do the trick, without going into details like how many words should be cancelled: context usually helps us. So if I say

> _I'm learning the English word, ‚Ä¶ er, Lojban word._

context and common sense dictate that _Lojban word_ is meant to replace _English word_. But what if it was meant to replace _I'm learning the English word_? We wouldn't normally care, in natural languages.

But Lojban allows you to be more precise about what words you are correcting.

**si** erases the immediately preceding word. If you want to erase two words in a row, you say **si si** after them. So the correction above would be in Lojban

> **.i mi tadni le glico valsi si si lojbo valsi**
> _I'm learning the English word, ‚Ä¶ er, Lojban word._

valsi
: $x_1$ is a word with the meaning $x_2$ in language $x_3$

The problem with **si** is, you have to count words. This can get tedious, and you shouldn't have to keep a transcript of your words when you want to correct yourself.

The other correction word Lojban offers is somewhat more helpful: **sa** takes the word following it, which starts the relation to serve as the correction. It then goes back in the sentence, looking for the last time you used a relation starting with the same word or another word of the same class (selma'o). Once it finds the last such relation, it replaces all text from that relation up to **sa** with the relation following **sa**. For example:

> **.i mi tadni le sa .i mi tadni le lojbo valsi**
> _I'm learning the ‚Ä¶ er, I'm learning the Lojban word._

The correction following **sa** is a sentence; you know that, because the first word after **sa** is the sentence marker, **.i**. So the sentence following **sa** replaces the current sentence up to and including **sa**. Or consider:

> **.i mi mrilu fi do de'i li jefydei bu pa sa de'i li jefydei bu re**
> _I mailed to you on Monday, ‚Ä¶ er, on Tuesday._
> _On Monday I mailed it to you, ‚Ä¶ er, actually, it was Tuesday._

The correction is **de'i li jefydei bu re** ‚Äî _on Tuesday_. So what it replaces is everything from the last relation beginning with **de'i**: **de'i li jefydei bu pa** ‚Äî _on Monday_.

### Dealing with misunderstanding

> **‚Äî .i mi pu zi te vecnu le flokati**
> **‚Äî .i le flokati ki'a**
> _‚Äî I just bought a flokati._
> _‚Äî Flokati, huh?_

ki'a
: interjection inquiry: confusion about something said. _Huh? Whaat?? (confusion), pardon?_

When you don't understand what someone has just said ‚Äî whether because you don't get what they were referring to, or you don't know the word, or the grammar confused you ‚Äî you can repeat the word or relation you didn't get, and add **ki'a** as a plaintive request for clarification (so it's even better than _Huh?_, because you can point out exactly what made you say _Huh?_)

Here is a dialogue.

> **‚Äî mi nelci le kalci**
> **‚Äî ki'a ?**
> _‚Äî I like shit._
> _‚Äî Whaat???_

**Note:** Since **zo** quotes any word following it ‚Äî any word ‚Äî it turns out that **zo ki'a** doesn't mean _zo? Huh?_ at all, but _The word **ki'a**._ To ask _zo? Huh?_, you'll have to resort to **zo zo ki'a**.

### Reverse ¬´**mi**¬ª and ¬´**do**¬ª using ¬´**ra'o**¬ª

> **- mi prami do**
> **- go'i ra'o**
> _- I love you._
> _- I love you too._

ra'o
: interjection: updates meaning from the viewpoint of the current speaker

If someone says **mi prami do** and you reply **go'i ra'o**, that reverses the pronouns **mi** and **do** so that they apply from your point of view. So every pronoun gets re-evaluated.

Compare:

> **- mi prami do**
> **- go'i**
> _- I love you._
> _- You do._

A simple **go'i** still makes **mi** refer to who used it and **do** refer to the listener of who said it.

## Lesson 11. Trickier topics

### Four meanings of ‚Äò_you_‚Äô in English

We've already seen two personal pronouns, **mi** and **do**, meaning _I_ (or _me_) and _you_. However, _you_ in English can mean four different things:

In English _you_ has several meanings that are translated to Lojban in certain ways:

- _you_ as _the one person I'm talking to_:

 > **le pa do**
 > _you one_

 We know that **le re prenu** means _the two people_. It's also possible to put numbers after **le** and before pronouns.

- _you_ as _all of the people I'm talking to_:

 > **ro do**
 > <span>_each of you_, _all of you_ (or Southern U.S. _y'all_)</span>

 You can also use numbers with **ko**:

 > **ro ko klama ti**
 > _All of you, get over here._

- _you_ as _a number of people I'm talking to_:

 > **le re do**
 > _you two_

 For example, once can start e-mails to their parents with **coi le re do**.

 Notice that **re do** means _two of you_ and **re le ci do** means _two of you three_.

- _you_ as _the person or people I'm talking to plus some other person or people_:

 do'o
 : pronoun: _you and someone else_

- _you_ as _anyone_ (e.g. _Money can't buy you love._):

 It's normally expressed by

 ro da
 : _all **da**_

 or

 ro lo prenu
 : _all persons_

 But often you can just miss it out altogether (or place **zo'e** in that place).
<!-- The recommended method is turning pronouns into verbs first:

>**lo re me do ko klama ti**
>_You two, come here._

It's possible to omit **me** in this position and say **lo re do ko klama ti** but this can lead to confusion in beginners. -->

### More about short relative clauses

Short relative clauses with a pronoun after them can be put just after **le**:

> **le pe mi gerku**
> **le gerku pe mi**
> _My dog_

**pe** in such cases can even be omitted:

> **le mi gerku**
> **le gerku pe mi**
> _My dog_

Thus, "**le** + noun + verb" is equivalent to "**le** + verb + **pe** + noun".

A few rules:

- if you want to use a noun converted from a verb (for example, with **le**) or a name then it's advisable to use **pe** and put it after the noun: **le gerku pe la .alis.** (_the Alice's dog_).
- it's okay to omit **pe** only if you use pronouns without numbers in front of them: **le do gerku** (_my dog_) but not **le pa do gerku** (= **le pa do cu gerku** = _you one is a dog_).

It's much safer to use **pe** explicitly and put it after the noun to which it is attached: **le gerku pe la .alis.** and **le gerku pe mi** are most intuitive constructs.

### Quoting text in different languages

**zoi** is a quotation mark for quoting non-Lojban text. Its syntax is **zoi X. text .X**, where X is a Lojban word (called the delimiting word) which is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and which is not found in the written text or spoken phoneme stream inside that quotation. It is common, but not required, to use the name of some letter, which corresponds to the Lojban name of the language being quoted:

> **zoi gy. John is a man .gy. cu glico jufra**
> _‚ÄúJohn is a man‚Äù is an English sentence._

where **gy.** stands for **glico**. Other popular choices of delimiting words are **.kuot.**, a Lojban name which sounds like the English word_quote_, and the word_zoi_ itself. Another possibility is a Lojban word suggesting the topic of the quotation.

Lojban strictly avoids any confusion between things and the names of things:

> **zo .bob. cmene la .bob.**
> `The-word ‚ÄúBob‚Äù is-the-name-of the-one-named Bob.`

**zo .bob.** is the word, whereas **la .bob.** is the thing named by the word. The short qualifier words **la'e** and **lu'e** placed before terms convert back and forth between references and their referents:

> **zo .bob. cmene la'e zo .bob.**
> _The-word ‚ÄúBob‚Äù is-the-name-of the-referent-of the-word ‚ÄúBob‚Äù._

<!-- -->

> **lu'e la .bob. cmene la .bob.**
> _A-symbol-for Bob is-the-name-of Bob._

Last two examples mean the same. But this is different:

> **la .bob. cu cmene la .bob.**
> _Bob is the name of Bob._

and says that Bob is both the name and the thing named, an unlikely situation. People are not names.

**la'o** serves to mark non-Lojban names, for example the Linnaean binomial names (such as "Homo sapiens"), which are the internationally standardized names for species of animals and plants.

Internationally known names which can more easily be recognized by spelling rather than pronunciation, such as _Goethe_, can also appear in Lojban text with **la'o**:

> **la'o dy. Goethe .dy. cu me la'o ly. Homo sapiens .ly.**
> _Goethe is a Homo sapiens._

Using **la'o** for all names rather than adapting them to Lojban, however, can make for a cumbersome text.

Everything expressed in text should also be expressed in speech and vice versa. Therefore, there cannot be any punctuation which is not pronounced. This means that Lojban has a wide range of words to quote other words. All Lojban convert a text into a noun.

**lu** ‚Ä¶ **li'u** quote only text that is grammatically correct. To quote any Lojban text we use **lo'u** ‚Ä¶ **le'u** quote instead.

> ‚Äî **xu lo'u je le'u lojbo sumsmi**
> ‚Äî **na ku sumsmi**
> _‚Äî Is "je" a term?_
> _‚Äî No._

<!-- -->

> **ma xe fanva zoi gy.What's up?.gy. la .lojban.**
> _How to translate "What's up?" to Lojban?_

### Enriching vocabulary. New words using tenses

Many English words correspond to word combinations in Lojban:

le ve'i cmana
: the hill (literally "mountain/hill covering little space")

le ve'u xamsi
: the ocean (literally "sea/ocean covering large space")

le ba'o tricu
: stump of a tree (literally "the no longer tree")

### Internal terms

Using **be** you can attach not only the default places of verbs but even terms:

> **le xatra be de'i li vo cu se mrilu de'i li ze**
> _This letter, dated the 4th, is mailed on the 7th_

xatra
: $x_1$ is a letter

A date tagged with **de'i** applies only to the **xatra**. Compare:

> **le xatra de'i li vo cu se mrilu de'i li ze**
> _The letter on the 4th is mailed in the 7th_ (whatever that can mean)

Without **be** the term **de'i li vo** would apply to the whole relation, not to **xatra**. What we want to say is that the former date applies just to the letter, and the latter date applies to the mailing of the letter. This means that the 4th, as a date, applies only to the verb **le xatra**, and not to the entire relation.

### Compound verbs in detail

The grouping of terms in Lojban grammar is particularly important when it comes to tanru (compound verbs). The way verbs group together in a tanru determines what that tanru means. For example,

> _the bad music magazine_

has in English two interpretations: a bad magazine about music, or a magazine about bad music. In Lojban, its equivalent

> **le xlali zgike karni**

has only the interpretation _a bad-music magazine_, because the first two verbs (_xlali zgike_ ‚Äî _bad music_) group together first. So it is important to be able to modify the grouping of verbs, so that we can make sure the tanru means what we actually intend it to mean. For that reason, Lojban has a couple of mechanisms in place for making tanru group together properly.

In English we use brackets to structure the text. Likewise for tanru we use **ke** for the left bracket and **ke'e** for the right bracket.

**le xlali ke zgike karni** means _the bad music-magazine_.

As you can see we separated **xlali** from the rest of the tanru and made it apply to the whole tanru. There is no need in **ke'e** in the end of the tanru since we already know that it ends here.

> **.i mi pu zi te vecnu le xlali ke zgike karni .i to'e zanru la'o gy.Eurythmics.gy.**
> _I just bought a bad music-magazine. It dissed the Eurythmics._

That's one way of grouping together verbs in tanru. The other way is to use **bo** in a new role. When **bo** appears between two verbs, it means that those verbs group together more tightly than anything else. So an alternative way of saying _bad {music magazine}_ is

le xlali zgike bo karni
: the bad music-magazine

**bo** here is similar to the hyphen in English translation. This means that **zgike bo karni** should count as a unit, to which **xlali** (_bad_) applies.

So **bo** makes the connections tighter:

> **la .doris. e la .alis. o nai bo la .bob.**
> _Doris and (either Alice or Bob)_

**ke** can also be used with connectives (though not with sentences; they have their own kind of bracket, **tu'e ‚Ä¶ tu'u**.) So we could also say

> **la .doris. e ke la .alis. o nai la .bob.**

Remember that the right bracket **ke'e** can be left out in most cases without changing the meaning (like in this case).

Forethought conjunction are also used a lot since they can eliminate the need in right brackets:

> **ge la .doris. gi go nai la .alis. gi la .bob.**
> _Doris and either Alice or Bob_

and

> **go nai ge la .doris. gi la .alis. gi la .bob.**
> _Either Doris and Alice, or Bob_

We don't need **bo** or **ke** with forethought conjunctions.

### ¬´**co**¬ª for changing the order in compound verbs

There is another way of restructuring compound verbs.

> **mi fanva se jibri**
> _I'm a professional translator_

jibri
: $x_1$ is a job of $x_2$

If I wanted to say that I'm a professional translator from English to German, I could use **be** and **bei**:

> **mi fanva be le dotco bei le glico be'o se jibri**
> _I'm a professional translator to German from English._

dotco
: $x_1$ is German

glico
: $x_1$ is English

The fact that it was a compound verb could quickly be lost in speech due to the complicated structure of the sentence. Here, we can use the word **co**:

**co** ‚Äî inverts the compound verb, making the rightmost verb word modify the leftmost instead of the other way around. Any previous noun fills the modified, any following noun fills the modifier.

> **mi se jibri co fanva le dotco le glico**

It is the same relation as the previous Lojban one, but much more easy to understand. Notice that any noun before the compound verb fills **se jibri**, while any following it only fills the modifying verb: **fanva**.

The strength by which two verbs are bound together with **co** is very weak ‚Äî even weaker than normal compound verb grouping without any grouping words. This makes sure that, in a co-construct, the leftmost component is always the verb being modified, and the rightmost component always modifies, even if any of those parts are compound verbs. This makes a co-construct easy to understand:

> **ti pelxu plise co kukte**

is read as **ti (pelxu plise) co kukte**, which is the same as **ti kukte pelxu bo plise**. This also means that a **ke ‚Ä¶ ke'e** cannot encompass a **co**.

Another example:

> **mi merko limna co mutce certu**
> _I am a much experienced American swimmer._

merko
: $x_1$ is American (the USA sense)

Here is the list of different kind of groupers in compound verbs ranked from the tighest to the most loose:

1. **bo** and **ke ‚Ä¶ ke'e**
2. logical connectives for compound verbs like **je**
3. not using grouping words
4. **co**

### Explicit termination of nouns

the small word **ku** can be used at the end of a noun to explicitly show its right border. **ku** is analogous to the right bracket in math.

> **tu du le badna ku ui**
> **tu du le ui badna**
> _That is the banana (yay!)_

as opposed to:

> **tu du le badna ui**
> _That is the banana (yay that it's a banana and not something else in nature!)_

### Avoiding explicit termination

Another style of speaking is to avoid termination. Here are some common cases:

Elimination of **li'u**, the right quotation mark:

> **lu mi prami do li'u cu se cusku la .alis.**
> **lu mi prami do li'u se cusku la .alis.**
> **lu mi prami do cu se cusku la .alis.**
> _"I love you,"" said Alice._

**li'u** can be elided here because there cannot be two main relation constructs in one sentence. Hence, we first read **lu mi prami do** part, and then when we see the **cu**, we realize that we cannot continue this quoted sentence further. We assume that the quotation ended and the outer sentence continues. Thus, no ambiguity arises. 

Elimination of **ku'o**, the right border of relative clauses:

> **le prenu noi mi zgana ke'a ku'o ca tavla le pendo be mi**
> **le prenu noi mi zgana ke'a ca tavla le pendo be mi**
> _The person whom I'm observing is now talking to my friend._

**ku'o** can be elided here when the relative clause that we need (**mi zgana ke'a**) ends in a term, **ke'a** in this case. After the relative clause, something other than a term starts, so the relative clause cannot be continued, and thus we know it successfully ends without any explicit right bracket words.

A similar trick would be to place **ke'a** always at the end of the relative clause:

> **le prenu noi ke'a melbi ku'o ca tavla le pendo be mi**
> **le prenu noi melbi fa ke'a ca tavla le pendo be mi**
> _The person who is pretty is now talking to my friend._

However, in the following case, termination is necessary:

> **le prenu noi mi zgana ke'a ku'o le pendo be mi ca tavla**
> _The person whom I'm observing is now talking to my friend._

because after the relative clause **mi zgana ke'a**, we chose to place another term (**le pendo be mi**) not belonging to the current relative clause.

A semi-trick here would be to use **ce'e**:

> **le prenu noi mi ke'a zgana ce'e le pendo be mi ca tavla**
> _The person whom I'm observing is now talking to my friend._

Here, we end the relative clause with the main relation construct **zgana**. Then we have the conjunction **ce'e** and a term afterwards (**le pendo be mi**). Since **ce'e** can join only terms, we know that to the left of **ce'e**, we have a term, which can only be **le prenu noi mi ke'a**. Hence, the meaning is retained, and no ambiguity arises. Note that we still need a separate word, **ce'e**, in such cases, so although we eliminated the bright bracket word, we still had to introduce something else.

Elimination of **kei**, the right border of inner sentences:

>**mi cinmo le ka badri kei le tcini**
>**le ka badri cu se cinmo mi le tcini**
>**mi cinmo fi le tcini fe le ka badri**
>**mi cinmo le ka badri ce'e le tcini**
>_I feel sad regarding the situation._

>**mi stidi lo ka citka su'o da kei do**
>**mi stidi lo ka ce'u su'o da citka ce'e do**
>_I suggest that you eat something._

As you can see, no trick makes the result shorter than the original with **kei**, so for conciseness, you may wish to use **kei**.
### Conversion from sets to masses

> **le prenu cu pa moi le'i pendo be mi ku noi lu'o ke'a ca smaji**
> _He is the first among my friends who keep silence together._
> _The person is the first among the set of my friends who are now as a crowd being silent._

The qualifier word **lu'o** placed before a noun converts it into a mass made of members of that noun. In this case **ke'a** refers to the set of my friends **le'i pendo be mi** and then **lu'o** converts the members of the set into a mass, the crowd of my friends.

### Sets and subsets

Some infinitives may imply more than one **ce'u**:

> **le'i prenu cu simxu le ka prami**
> **le'i prenu cu simxu le ka ce'u prami ce'u**
>_The people love each other._

simxu
: members of the set $x_1$ reciprocally do $x_2$

The verb **simxu** takes every possible pair from the set specified in place $x_1$ at asserts the relation specified within $x_2$.

If we have three people then it would mean all of them love each other.

> **do ce la .alis. ce mi simxu le ka prami**
> **do ce la .alis. ce mi simxu le ka ce'u prami ce'u**
> _You, Alice and I all love each other._

ce
: conjunction: turns several nouns/pronouns into a set

The conjunction **ce** connects nouns and pronouns into a set, thus **do ce la .alis. ce mi** might be a more verbose way of **le'i prenu** from the previous example for the case when we want to name the members of the set.

In total we assert 6 relations:

1. You love Alice.
2. You love me.
3. Alice loves me.
4. Alice loves you.
5. I love Alice.
6. I love you.

Hence, **simxu** is a nice shortcut for expressing mutual relation.

Now consider the example:

> **le'i su'o cmima be le'i prenu cu simxu le ka prami**
> _Some of the people love each other._

cmima
: $x_1$ is a member of set $x_2$

In this example we are showing that a subset of the people in question (a subset of **le'i prenu**) has mutual love.

This allows us to convey even trickier ideas:

> **le'i su'o citno cmima be le'i stati prenu cu simxu le ka prami**
> _Some youngsters from those smart people love each other._
> `Some young members of the set of smart people love each other.`

<!-- ## Second order logic

We've seen **da** (and **de**, **di**) being a "variable" in noun form with declared meanings depending on propositions given.
It's usually translated as _there is X, there are X such that ‚Ä¶_

However, for curiosity I must mention the series of verbs that also serve the purpose of "variables" but in verb, i.e. relationship form:

>**su'o bu'a zo'u mi bu'a do**
>_There is some relationship or property: I have this relationship to you._
> _You and I are related in at least one way._

>**ro bu'a zo'u ga nai le'e mlatu cu bu'a gi la .dinas. bu'a**
>>_For every possible relation or property: if cats have it then Dinah has it too._ (Thus we assume Dinah is a cat.)

The reasoning behind these variable verbs is hidden in formal logic. Needless to say, they are rearely used in speech but here is one possible example:

su'o bu'a zo'u ge ge da na bu'a gi su'o da su'o de zo'u ge da .e de bu'a gi da manci de gi ro da ro de zo'u da bu'a .ije da manci de .inaja de bu'a
- fix the sentence -->

<!-- ## Things not yet formalized in Lojban

Though Lojban might be the speakable language No.1 in the world is how detailed its grammar is. Still there are some
It's unknown what **ta'e na** means as opposed to **na ta'e**.

It's unknown how to deal with **na go'i**.

It's unknown how xorlo works when we need explicit conversion between sets and masses, how to operate sets in general, how to use xorlo together with second order logic like bu'a.

postoxorlo working with anaphora and outer quantifiers. -->

<!-- ## Non-standard connective system

Some people for connecting nouns instead of

- **a**, **e**, **o**, **u**

use

- **ja**, **je**, **jo**, **ju**

That is instead of

>**mi e do nelci le plise**
>_I like apples, and you like apples._

they say

>**mi je do nelci le plise**
>_I like apples, and you like apples._

This is a non-standard approach. People use this style because in it there are fewer conjunctions to remember.

But you should be careful not to forget **le** or numbers to form nouns: **mi nelci le plise je jisra** would mean _I like something that is an apple (or apples) and is juice_ (?!)

The correct sentence uses **le** to form every noun:

>**mi nelci le plise je le jisra**
>_I like apples and juice._

In standard approach the speaker uses a separate conjunction **e** when connecting nouns, and it's easier to see the difference and the correct meaning:

>**mi nelci le plise .e le jisra**
>_I like apples and juice._ -->
